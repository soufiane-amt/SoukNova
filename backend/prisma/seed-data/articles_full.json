            "Mirrors in thehallwayare a tricky thing. On the one hand, they can be stylish decorative elements that significantly shape the look of your entrance area. On the other hand, they also have a practical function. Before you leave the house, you quickly check whether your coat fits, your hair is done and whether a scarf makes sense or not.",
            "Where exactly does the mirror fit best in your hallway? And which shapes are suitable for which styles? In the following idea book, we have put together a few modern looks for you.",
            "Hallways come in all sizes and shapes, but they are often neglected in terms of design compared to other rooms.",
            "To create a welcoming atmosphere, it is worth looking extensively for the right mirror. On the long sides of a hallway, a mirror visually enlarges the room.",
            "We recommend:10 Amazing Ideas to Get that Gorgeous Entrance to Your Home.",
            "Without going into too much detail aboutFeng Shuiat this point, it should be said that Far Eastern teachings certainly have an opinion on mirrors.",
            "You should avoid mirrors on the wall opposite the front door. As soon as a visitor comes to your home, their reflection,their karma,will be reflected. For this reason, according toFeng Shui,guests do not feel welcome.",
            "The size is a question of taste. It certainly makes sense to choose a hallway mirror that gives you enough information about your appearance.",
            "Large mirrors are therefore not only impressive but also practical. Smaller models, on the other hand, are more flexible in terms of design and can be used more as a decorative element.",
            "You should hang your mirror so that your face is aligned with the middle of the mirror. With longer models, this rule of thumb can be treated more flexibly, although mirrors that hang too low can quickly look squat.",
            "A wooden frame gives the cool elegance of the mirror surface a balancing touch. Natural charm combines with timelessness.",
            "Frames are made from different materials. Resin, plastic compounds, stainless steel, cast iron and more all have different feels and looks.",
            "The main aim is to support the desiredinterior designstyle. In general, plastic frames are not recommended unless they are made of recycled material.",
            "Classic frames give the mirror a special elegance and make it the focal point in every hallway, regardless of its size.",
            "Antique gold frames can be recognized by the fact that they are covered in gold leaf. This makes the surface a little uneven and the colouring less uniform.",
            "If you have a certain retro chic style in your home, you can combine it wonderfully with a matching hallway mirror. You can find second-hand pieces as well as purchase high-quality new productions.",
            "Which type of retro you choose is of course entirely up to you. The brave ones even dare to mix different styles.",
            "Frameless mirrors are not just for the bathroom. These mirror models are usually so understated that they almost seem cold.",
            "You can combine them with impressive wall colours and pieces of furniture. The more the size of the mirror matches its surroundings, the more harmonious the overall ensemble will be.",
            "Modern mirrors come in all sorts of shapes, materials and colours. They help you to create a harmonious design even in a neglected hallway.",
            "So plan it right from the start, whether you are building a new house or renovating it.",
            "Round mirrors appear in various living spaces. Their organic shape reflects a desire for closeness to nature and security.",
            "There are no sharp corners or edges here. Cosy hallways are in fashion, because here too the living area is more than just a walk-through room.",
            "The Scandi style is only sparingly suited to design with mirrors. This is mainly because proximity to nature is important and it is more about working with natural fibers and wood.",
            "When mirrors are used, they follow a clear decorative language, small bows to the elemental powerof waterand its manifold reflections.",
            "Illuminated mirrors in the hallway are a great thing. Ultimately, it's worth taking a closer look at this point.",
            "Such models are still unusual, but that shouldn't stop you from installing an illuminated mirror. Check beforehand whether there is already a power connection for the wall lighting.",
            "Mirroring a built-in closet in the entrance area kills two birds with one stone. Jackets, coats and shoes disappear after you arrive and you can check your face for any inconsistencies at the same time.",
            "A straightforward solution for the hallway that impresses with its elegance and is, therefore, suitable for almost any interior design style.",
            "Integrating wardrobes skilfully into a home style is not always easy. However, some models look like built-in wardrobes, even if they are not built-in wardrobes.",
            "A large mirror connected to it makes the transition to the wall disappear. With this type of variant, it is simply a question of correct placement and installation.",
            "A mirror does not always have to be visible. Especially if you are planning to integrate a wardrobe into the hallway, an internal mirror can be a good option.",
            "Since this is only possible with swing doors, this option is particularly suitable for larger hallways in which the mirror is not intended to be used to visually expand the area."

            "Cola is the number 1 soft drink in the world and is considered to be an extremely popular thirst quencher. But there are many other things that you can use the brown soft drink for. That may sound unbelievable, but it is possible and incredibly practical. The cola hacks that we want to show you today may sound quite unusual, but if you try them out, the results are amazing. Whether in thegarden,on the balcony or terrace, in the kitchen, in the bathroom, in the garage or even in the beauty area—a simple soft drink can enrich your everyday life enormously. Today we present you our top ten of the best cola hacks. So, off to the fridge!",
            "Do you have a can of Coke left over from your cosy barbecue? Great! Pour it into the toilet bowl. No, we don't want to act like health advocates here and you don't want to flush it straight away—quite the opposite. The soft drink is meant to act as a toilet cleaner and is therefore left to work overnight. The next morning, any deposits, stubborn limescale and dirt will have been dissolved by the citric acid contained in the drink without any annoying scrubbing.",
            "The soft drink can also be a practical helper in the kitchen. Using cola can save you time-consuming scrubbing and brushing, as the drink is ideal for cleaning burnt-on food in uncoated pots and pans.",
            "To do this, simply pour some cola into the pot so that the crusted bottom is covered and leave it to work for a while, ideally overnight. The next morning, the dirt can be easily removed with a dishwashing sponge. Another, quicker option is to boil the soft drink in a dirty pan or burnt pot for a few minutes.",
            "If you're not paying attention for a moment, it's already happened: a stain, and on your new shirt at that. No stain remover to hand? Here, too, you can safely reach for a Coke. The soft drink is excellent for removing annoying grease, blood or even felt-tip pen stains from clothing.",
            "Simply apply some cola, leave it to work for a while and put it in the washing machine with the dirty clothes. After that, the stain will be gone. But be careful: you should not use dark-coloured soda on light or white fibres.",
            "Dull, calcified tiles make even the most beautifulbathroomlook dull. Here, reaching for a bottle of Coke can help. The soft drink is very suitable as a tile cleaner. To make the tiles shine, add a quarter litre of sugar-free Coke to the cleaning water, wipe and the dull tiles on the walls and floors will shine in their old glory again.",
            "For stubborn stains, you can also pour the cola directly onto the affected tiles and then rinse with plenty of water.",
            "A pool should be cleaned regularly to ensure a pleasant bathing experience and also for hygienic reasons. But cleaning a pool also means a lot of work and is usually a rather annoying chore.",
            "But the popular soft drink is supposed to help here too, and the pool will be sparkling clean again with cola. It is recommended to add two litres of cola directly to the pool water. Due to the acids it contains, the soft drink in the water is supposed to act as a practical rust remover and nothing stands in the way of bathing pleasure. However, if you are unsure about this tip, you should contact our pool professionals directly.",
            "Iffurniturehas paint stains as a result of renovation work, rubbing the furniture with a cloth soaked in cola and then rinsing with water will ensure that these are removed immediately.",
            "The brown soft drink can also be used cleverly in the beauty sector to remove colour. A hair conditioner with sugar-free cola removes hair dye from the hair if you have used the wrong colour. A permanently dyed hair colour can be lightened by a few shades with a soft drink. To do this, pour a bottle of cola onto your hair in the shower, let it work for a few minutes and then wash the hair out with a standard shampoo.",
            "Cola can also be used in the garden as a cheap and effective pest control without using any toxic pesticides. To do this, pour a little cola into a small bowl. Insects such as beetles, snails or flies are attracted to the sweet soda, fall into the drink and are destroyed by the phosphoric and carbonic acid it contains.",
            "A cheap and effective wasp trap can also be made easily with a little cola. To do this, cut off the top third of an empty plastic bottle, just below the neck. This piece is then put upside down in the bottle and stuck firmly with adhesive tape. The bottom is now filled with sugary cola, as this attracts the wasps. If the annoying little creatures climb through the narrow opening, there is no turning back for them and the insect problem is solved.",
            "Another trick to remove unwanted insects from the car window without much effort is to soak a cloth in cola and wipe it quickly over the window. However, you should be careful not to touch the car paint to avoid paint damage.",
            "Cola not only removes unwanted stains from clothing but also acts as an extremely effective neutralizer of stubborn odours. The soft drink is particularly effective at neutralizing gasoline, fish, and even animal odours. To remove odours from clothing, simply add a quarter litre of sugar-free cola to the washing machine during the normal wash cycle.",
            "Rusty objects can be cleaned again with cola. The phosphoric acid effectively dissolves the existing rust. Smaller objects can be left in the drink for a while to remove the rust. Otherwise, the soft drink is simply poured onto a cloth and the rust is polished away.",
            "Rusty screws or nuts can also be loosened with cola. Simply turn the screw or nut a little, then repeatedly moisten it with cola and allow it to take effect. The screw or nut should now be easier to loosen.",
            "Fresh flowers in pretty vases are a wonderful eye-catcher in the house. But water alone is not enough to keep the flowers fresh for long. To make them last longer, it is recommended to put a little cola in the vase. The sugar contained in the soft drink keeps the flowers fresh, colourful and lively for longer.",
            "This also applies to flowers on the balcony, terrace and in the garden. By adding cola to flowers such as azaleas or gardenias, the flowers can be fertilized safely and inexpensively."

            "Just as the living room and foyer are the face of a home and give guests an idea about home owner's status, the façade and front porch enhance its curb appeal. Even if the porch is small with a slim verandah and few steps leading up to the door it can be the perfect place to greet guests or even relax on evenings and just watch the people on the road. As the porch is a home's face to the outside world special attention has to be paid to create a presentable area with appropriate furniture, decorative plants and other details. Here are some ideas given by ourdecoratorsthat you can use to give a charming aura to this space and enjoy winter sunshine as long as it lasts.",

            "Have a prefabricated house and are wondering if a porch can be accommodated, then explore this industrial style idea that has used two platforms to create an open porch.

The plain table and chairs add to the industrial style of this simple porch.",
            "There is no restriction on the type of ideal furniture for porches as the region can also become an ideal platform for showing off off vintage furniture that one owns. If you have classical style chintz or natural fabric covered antique furniture pieces lying around in the garage then showcase them on your porch. Get them repaired from acarpenterthat knows how to restore old furniture and urge him to make an antique worn out table with distressed wood the serving station for your porch.",

            "A loft is a storage or industrial space that has been converted into an apartment, hence the name, which in English simply describes an attic orstorage room.",
            "In the 1940s, the first empty warehouses in New York City and London were converted into living spaces, with the building structure barely being changed. The apartments often covered the entire floor area. Furniture was simply placed inside. This is how the typical open apartments with large floor areas and high ceilings were created.",
            "Modern lofts are no longer improvised apartments. They are created through extensive renovations of old industrial halls. Some new apartments andhouseswith an open design are also offered as lofts. Elements such as exposed concrete, unplastered brickwork exposed pipes, etc. are typical here.",
            "Typical for the look of a loft are the high concrete walls and the spacious area of the apartment. Large window fronts, reminiscent of the original use of a loft or warehouse, are also characteristic. Todecoratethe apartment beautifully, white and brown furniture, some of which have a retro look, was used. A rather inconspicuous ceiling light provides the right light and ambience.",
            "A historic cotton mill from the 19th century was extensively renovated for this residential loft. The open and flexible floor plan was nevertheless retained to underline the character of the loft. A screed grid was installed in the ceiling area to enable the installation of lights, projectors and more.",
            "The existing screed in the floor was sanded and impregnated with a colourless finish, and any defects were repaired. The conversion is rounded off with the rightfurnishings.Modern furniture in cognac and turquoise and a red carpet brings a cosy warmth to the cool loft.",
            "Entire houses can also be built and furnished in the style of a loft. Clinker walls, together with concrete and load-bearing beams and ceiling structures, create an industrial look. The modern furnishings and the stove attached to the ceiling make for an eye-catcher and a cosy atmosphere.",
            "This friendly loft was designed on two floors. The clinker wall and the rustic gallery in industrial design match the white walls and the fine parquet floor perfectly. The furnishings are in grey and brown colours. The lighting and the choice of pictures are subtle.",
            "A white loft is also a beautiful and trendy design idea. White and grey tones create a homely atmosphere in this living example. Concrete elements underline the cool look of this living loft even more.",
            "An old workshop shines in new splendour. In this loft apartment, great importance was placed on an old-school implementation of the loft idea. Cosy comfort together with ultra-modern kitchen and electrical appliances not only harmonize, they also provide a first-class living experience. The Schmidt kitchen was installed according to the customer's wishes.",
            "In this modern loft, light and steel elements are at the heart of the design. On the top floor of the loft, two galleries are connected by a long suspended walkway. Above the walkway is a glass roof that opens up the view of the sky.",
            "This comfortably designed loft features a lot of wood combined with clinker bricks and metal elements. The warm atmosphere is further enhanced by the use of targeted lighting. Large windows with wooden frames and modern furniture such as the red bar stools complete the look of this special loft.",

            "To avoid exactly this and to show you the potential ofbasement rooms,we have selected three surprising basement transformations, each of which is surprising in its way.",
            "Today we're going down to the basement. Designing and remodelling a basement is always a very exciting challenge, even forinterior designers.Depending on the individual customer's wishes, there are many design options. Today we have selected three particularly impressivebefore and after projects,each of which involves a basement conversion. It doesn't always have to be a storage room: you can set up the basement however you personally like best and how it fits in with your own life. So take a look at ourbasement renovation before and afterprojects below and let yourself be inspired. Maybe you'll find a few great basement ideas that you'd like to implement in your own home.",
            "Do you want to renovate your kitchen? Then you should read thisidea bookthat shows you how our interior designers were able to transform these kitchens!",
            "Here we see a cellar that many of us know: relatively small, with a rather unsightly floor and not particularly well designed. The only bright spot is the relatively large window for a cellar.",
            "In the next picture, you will be amazed at how big this room is.",
            "There is room for a sink, a shower and a bathtub in the basement. Natural stone plays the main role here and makes the bathroom appear particularly exclusive. A three-dimensional arrangement of the natural stones makes the wall next to the bathtub a fascinating eye-catcher. The unusual wall design is highlighted with ceiling spotlights. But the natural stone doesn't end there on the wall! Both the tub itself and the washbasin are made of natural stone or are covered with it. The brown ceramic tiles also had to make way for large, anthracite-coloured natural stone tiles.",
            "We recommend:5 Bathroom Renovations That Will Leave You In Awe!",
            "If you lie in the tub, you have this view. Here we can also see where the shower is hidden. It is not surprising that it was also designed entirely with natural materials. But a surprising contrast was allowed: opposite the washbasin, we find tubular steel shelves in the trendy industrial style.",
            "Having a swimming pool in your home is undoubtedly a luxury that not everyone can afford. But even a simple swimming pool loses its appeal at some point. That's why the owners of this property decided to have their basement converted into a true wellness temple.",
            "While we see a picture of the gutting phase here, the next picture shows the amazing result of the basement conversion…",
            "Here you find everything you need for perfect relaxation at home. Starting with the designer sauna, which impresses with its dark walnut interior. It is still bright inside thanks to a floor-to-ceiling glass front and a light strip above the seating and lying area. Also noteworthy is the original lighting of the backrest, the colour tones of which can be adjusted on request.",
            "A horizontal shower, which we can see on the left in the picture, is causing a stir. As the name suggests, you shower lying down while six water jets come out of the shower area above.",
            "This basement wouldn't be a wellness temple if a sauna and an unusual shower were all it had. A steam bath was also installed and this too has a very modern and transparent design. The converted room also has a large washbasin and anormalshower, which is no less impressive.",
            "Impatience is not always a bad thing. For example, the owner of this house decided at short notice to simply redesign his basement himself. In just six weeks, with a budget of around €87, he managed to give the room a completely new look.",
            "And the surprise worked! Nobody would have expected such a transformation. What has emerged here is a genuineman cave.",
            "Wooden panelling on the walls, guns, animal trophies and a (fake) fireplace make the cellar a unique retreat with a haunting atmosphere. To ensure that you would survive a zombie apocalypse, canned goods are a must.",
            "A lot of work and attention to detail went into this basement conversion. The shelf on the right, for example, was made from old wooden boxes. The highlight, however, is thewindow: this is simply a photograph that is backlit with light. This trick can even be used to simulate different times of day."

Our tip: With the right roof, you can extend the bathing season and use your pool whatever the weather.",

The result: crystal-clear water all year round—and all without chemicals.",

            "When we talk about a semi-detached house, we mean half of a house, where both halves have separate entrances and are each occupied by a separate party. As a rule, the external appearance of semi-detached houses is uniform, but there are also differences, especially in modern architecture, as our first photo shows. Here, both houses were treated as a single unit in terms of design but still have their details. So if you want to build or buy a semi-detached house, you shouldn't be put off by the apparent monotony, because when it comes to the division of the rooms and the general design, you can usually go your way and set yourself apart from your neighbour.",
            "If you want to build a semi-detached house, you have to consider a few aspects in terms of construction technology that are not the case with a single-family house. The main focus is on the shared side wall of the two halves of the house, which must be equipped with particularly good sound insulation. Another important point is the orientation of the two semi-detached houses on the plot so that one of them is not in the shadow of the other. The planning of the window areas and lines of sight should also be carefully considered and tailored to the special nature of the semi-detached house.",
            "The biggest advantage of a semi-detached house is the financial aspect. The price of the land is shared, as are the planning costs for the construction, as well as administrative and notary costs and taxes. In addition, less land is needed to build a semi-detached house than to build a single-family home, as there are no minimum distances. And: The divider wall between the two halves of thehousealso saves energy costs, as there is no heat loss to the outside. According to experts, you can save up to 25 per cent when building a semi-detached house compared to building a single-family home.",
            "The disadvantage of living in a semi-detached house is the immediate proximity to the neighbours. When building or buying, and also later in the case of renovation and repair work, agreements are unavoidable and not all individual ideas can always be implemented. Due to the inevitable close contact points, there are also more potential neighbourly disputes than with a detached single-family home, which is why it is advisable to take a closer look at your future neighbours if you are planning to buy or build a semi-detached house.",
            "If you weigh up the advantages and disadvantages of a semi-detached house, everyone has to decide for themselves whether this living concept is suitable for their own family or not. You should ask yourself a few questions in advance before you go ahead and buy. For example, you should ask yourself how tolerant you are and how you cope with being close to other people and the possible restrictions. Families often decide to build a semi-detached house together with grandma and grandpa, other relatives or friends. Conclusion: If you describe yourself as an easy-going and sociable person who doesn't shy away from close quarters, a semi-detached house is a cheaper alternative to a detached single-family home.",
            "Most semi-detached houses have the same floor plan—the only difference being that one is built as a mirror image of the other. Here we see the ground floor plan of a semi-detached house in the classic style. The entrances are opposite each other, a spacious living room was planned on one side of the hallway, and the kitchen and dining area on the other. Both houses also have a toilet and a storage room on the ground floor, while they share the technical room that is accessible from the outside.",
            "Here we see proof that semi-detached houses do not have to be stuffy, uniform and boring. In this project, a plot of land was divided as part of densification measures and the old single-family house was replaced by a modern semi-detached house. The woodenfacadeand alternating roof pitches and window arrangements give this a very special touch and therefore appear anything but boring and uniform.",
            "This project proves that you can implement your ideas and concepts in a semi-detached house. Here, the right-hand semi-detached house was given a carport on the side and the white plaster facade was combined with partial wooden cladding, which gives the whole thing a modern and varied touch.",
            "If the semi-detached house becomes too small, it can often be easily extended with extensions. In this case, two pent-roof extensions of different heights were added to the existing building. The main extension now houses a new living room on the ground floor and a bedroom on the upper floor. There is also a single-storey extension with a new entrance area.",
            "Here, a traditional semi-detached house was given a modern extension, creating more living space for the residents with a contemporary ambience and direct access to thegarden.",
            "This complex of five semi-detached houses is dedicated to the topics of ecology and sustainability. When selecting the materials and building materials used, emphasis was placed on circular economy and locality, and they were installed in their raw form, largely untreated.",
            "Here, too, several modern semi-detached houses were planned and built with energy efficiency and sustainability in mind. These are low-energy houses with energy efficiency class KfW 55, which were built using highly insulated timber frame construction.",
            "Semi-detached houses have been around for many decades. In this project, our experts converted a semi-detached house from the 1950s and renovated it to be more energy-efficient. This means that residents can not only enjoy more space and living comfort, but energy consumption has also been significantly reduced through roof insulation, mineral facade insulation and basement ceiling insulation.",
            "Here we see once again how individual living in a semi-detached house can be. The size and arrangement of the windows, the colour of the facade, the garden design and many other things can usually be decided by yourself if you decide to build a semi-detached house.",
            "This semi-detached house was built on a hillside and uses the slope of the property to spread the entrance and living areas over three levels, which can be experienced from anywhere via a spacious, open staircase."

We'll prove you wrong—with these decoration ideas from ourinterior designers,you can give your four walls a completely new look, without any renovation!",
            "Instead of calling in an expert to install new windows for you, invest in beautifullightingthat will give your rooms a bright and inviting ambience. A beautiful pendant light, wall lamps or recessed spotlights are the perfect choice to give your home more brightness and a feel-good atmosphere.",
            "Every room has a floor, but we often don't take advantage of the design options. When you think about how much space the floor takes up, it makes sense to invest in a floor covering that turns our rooms into a highlight. Whether wood, stone or individual tiles—there are numerous variations available, depending on what suits your interior design style best.",
            "You'll be surprised how much of a difference replacing doors can make. With practical sliding doors, for example, you can expand your rooms so that they appear much larger and more spacious.",
            "Here you will find breathtakingly beautifulsliding doorsthat will enrich any room!",
            "Curtains or blinds give every room a homely atmosphere. Colourful designs, for example, are an ideal choice for giving classic interiors a touch of freshness. Make sure that the curtains let in a little light—this will make your living spaces appear wonderfully bright and inviting.",

            "Of course, we also want a stylish atmosphere for the outdoor area.

How about a wonderful wooden floor, like in this example, to create a small wellness oasis for relaxation and well-being?",

            "With property prices constantly rising, living space becomes particularly scarce when the family grows. Having enough space without going over the top is a real challenge for many. But you don't have to look for a new apartment straight away if you suddenly need more space. There are an incredible number of great options that you can use to expand your four rooms without having to build an extension. Whether it's a mini house, a caravan or a ten-square-metre student apartment—they all show how functional, stylish and space-saving living can be. Among the following six ideas, you're sure to find some that will help you get the most out of your home!",
            "Attics often don't seem to be the most attractive place in thehouse.They often exude fear and terror and seem spooky and mysterious rather than cosy. However, with a little skill, for example with the help of one of ourinterior design experts,they can become a cosy place in the house. The attic can, for example, become a small guest room, a library or even the long-awaited walk-in closet. Some attics are even huge and offer the structural possibilities to transform them into a real loft!",
            "Garages are far too often overlooked as an option when it comes to creating additional space. But the garage has a lot of potential. There is usually room for two cars in them, even if you only own one or the second is always parked outside anyway. In any case, the garage is a great place for all the equipment that takes up a lot of space in the house. This includes fitness equipment as well as the hobby workshop. In the garage, you can drill and hammer without disturbing anyone. You can hang up the punching bag without having to worry about unsightly holes in the ceiling. Sometimes garages are even built so robustly and heat-insulated that they can be converted into an additional room. They are also an ideal place to set up a small studio. There is enough space for the sewing machine, large lengths of fabric and a mannequin that you can let off steam on as you please.",
            "Unused basements are a complete waste of space. Instead of letting old junk rust away, you can gain a lot of space by converting the basement. Here, for example, the basement has been turned into a real wellness oasis. A sophisticated lighting concept, clear shapes and a few light-coloured pieces of furniture make the rooms appear larger and create a relaxed atmosphere. Instead of storing old clothes in the basement, piling up accessories for long-forgotten hobbies or storing broken furniture there, the basement should be dusted off. Many activities that take up space in the other rooms or cause unrest can be outsourced to the basement. It can become a huge play area for the children, giving them more space in the children's room, a music room or a multimedia temple.",
            "You'll also like this idea book:3 x Inspiration for an Ingenious Basement Conversion!",
            "Walls that remain unused are a complete waste of space. A tip that works in almost every room is to use the wall space. Shelves that reach from floor to ceiling in the hallway, living room, bedroom or children's room create an incredible amount of storage space. They can even replace the wall or be used as a room divider. In many families, the children share a children's room or the bedroom or living room must also serve as a home office. In such cases, shelves as room dividers can almost visually create an additional room. But shelves are not the only way to use the wall space. Hooks in the bathroom or kitchen offer additional space for all kinds of utensils, boards that run through the entire room and above the doors can accommodate book collections and a bench on the wall offers additional seating in the hallway or kitchen.",
            "Another place that is often overlooked when looking for more space is thestairs.Even though it sounds a bit like Harry Potter's room under the stairs, it can become a cosy little living space. One option is to create storage space under the stairs. This can be done with the help of simple shelves that are screwed to the wall, or with sophisticated drawer and cabinet systems that are made to measure. It is also possible to set up a small bar or even a small workstation here. A comfortable armchair and a small side table—as in the example here—turn the space under the stairs into a great reading corner for enjoyment and relaxation.",
            "An apartment without a balcony, a house without a terrace—for many people, that's out of the question. It's all the more surprising to see how often this space remains unused. When you notice that the balcony furniture is only taken out once a year, it's time for changes. A covered sofa corner on the terrace invites you to sit outside even in a little drizzle, if a heater provides pleasant warmth, and a small sun lounger on the balcony may be used more often than the chic but uncomfortable balcony chairs. A great alternative for barbecue fans who aren't allowed to light charcoal on their balcony is small electric grills. They can be quickly fired up even after work and create a barbecue atmosphere without much preparation being necessary."

How it works: A garden hose is connected to the base plate, you stand on the plate and the water shoots upwards from 22 nozzles. The height of the water fountains varies between two and four metres, depending on the water pressure. With its dimensions of 70 x 55 cm, the floor shower is ideal for refreshment insmall gardens.",
            "The materialAISI 316is also used to manufacture this double shower. Incidentally, this stainless steel is also used to manufacture surgical instruments because it is particularly hygienic. In shipbuilding, this stainless steel is valued for its enormous corrosion resistance, which is why this outdoor shower even comes with a ten-year guarantee. This refers to the fact that there will be no corrosion on the shower column. With a height of 2.30 metres, people of all ages and sizes can easily refresh themselves underneath."

            "You should also ensure that there is enough light and air. It is important that there is a natural supply of air and that natural light comes in. If you ventilate regularly, you will prevent moisture damage and the formation of mould.",
            "The washing machine is integrated into a bathroom base cabinet. This means it disappears into the bathroom's ambience. Even if there is little space, try to integrate a work surface into the room.",
            "In the case of a small bathroom, this space can be used for two purposes. If you organize the space, it also offers space for pre-sorting or folding laundry. A washing machine base cabinet is offered in both bathroom and kitchen areas as part of the overall installation. As a stand-alone base cabinet, inexpensive models are available from €100.",
            "Custom-made built-in cupboards provide the perfect storage space to house the washing machine alongside other utensils.",
            "In addition to washer-dryer combinations, unexpected items are also stored together with the machines. In this bathroom, for example, the same cupboard can provide space for towels and bath towels, or cleaning products and a vacuum cleaner.",
            "A utility cupboard can also fit well in the entrance area or hallway, provided there is enough space.",
            "Whether you can install a washing machine or dryer in this location and hide it in the utility cupboard depends on whether there is a water connection, sewage connection and an electricity connection here.",
            "There is a lot hidden behind the elegant front of this tailor-made kitchen. There is also space for a washing machine, which is both a surprising and elegant solution.",
            "Especially for apartments located on higher floors, such as maisonettes or penthouses, which do not offer direct access to a basement and possible laundry room, accommodating the laundry area within the living area is a charming alternative.",
            "Unusual apartments require unusual solutions, including when it comes to the laundry room. For example, a washing machine and dryer cabinet can also be installed in an attic apartment.",
            "The tall cupboard is installed right next to the terrace access. Hidden behind panels and exposed to good air circulation, the washing machine, dryer and even dishwasher also find a place here.",
            "Some landlords require proof that the washing machine has been installed by a professional upon moving in.",
            "The reason for this is often that this is the only way the tenant's personal liability insurance will be covered in the event of damage. I recommend that you clarify these terms with your landlord in advance.",
            "Setting up a laundry room next to the storage shelf in the garage is also a good option.",
            "However, the conditions here must also be checked in advance. A garage with a window is ideal so that good air circulation can be guaranteed.",
            "It is recommended to install a sink or utility sink near the washing machine. In addition to the worktop, this is another useful component of a well-organized laundry room.",
            "Admittedly, washing machines are not necessarily the most elegant of companions. And yet they are one of the necessary features of a modern home. Their bulky and, in some cases, not particularly design-oriented appearance should not stop you from making your home as comfortable as possible with them.",
            "Especially if the washing machine and dryer are integrated into open or closed cabinets to find space in the kitchen or bathroom, it is worth matching them to their surroundings. A vase of flowers placed on the worktop above works wonders."

            "Let's go to Würzburg's Steinbachtal, where asingle-family housewith a granny flat built in 1964 was waiting to be converted and renovated. The new owners wanted to adapt it to their needs. Together with ourprofessionalsfromStefan Lang I Architecture and Energy,they courageously took on this project and transformed the building into an Efficiency House 70. Thanks to full thermal insulation, triple-glazed windows and a wood pellet heating system, the 224 m² living space can be heated efficiently after the conversion.",
            "Stay tuned for an amazingrenovation project!",
            "This is how the existing building lookedbeforethe renovation work. The street view shows a small, ageing house with a double garage directly adjacent. The dark-covered gable roof made the building appear rather squat, and overall everything looked a bit old-fashioned.",
            "What a change! After the work was completed, the house had a Bauhaus character: the facade is now sleek and cubic, and the old gable roof was removed and replaced with a contemporary flat roof. A restrained colour scheme of light grey and beige was also chosen. The entrance area was moved and covered with a roof that seamlessly merges into the garages. This makes everything look as if it were made from a single piece.",
            "If we look at the house from the side, its true size becomes apparent. This is by no means a small bungalow, as one might think at first glance. The location on the slope of the property meant that two floors could be built. From the side, we can also see the new, large window fronts, which let in a lot of light and provide a view of the outdoors.",
            "The perspective from the rear reveals several terrace levels and a balcony across the entire width of the house. Here, the owners can enjoy their open space with a view of the beautiful garden and find a suitable spot at any time of day or year.",
            "A lot of wood was used on theterrace.Both the floor and the bench are made from beautiful natural materials. A real eye-catcher, however, is the privacy screen from the neighbours, which consists of stacked logs."

            "Natural light, bright furniture and mirrors – 11 ingenious ideas with which you can give your apartment a few more square metres in no time at all!",
            "The most important thing is that there is enough natural light in your home, as this automatically makes theroomappear larger. The light floods the room during sunny hours and also creates a pleasant ambience—no matter how small the room is.",
            "You'll find more articles about lightinghere.",
            "To give the room depth and structure, you should use clever contrasts. In thisliving room, you can see a successful symbiosis of light flooring and dark walls. The combination of white and black easily enlarges the room, stretches it and creates an open atmosphere.",
            "When choosingfurniturefor your home, you should also make sure that it fits perfectly into the space. There is simply no point in squeezing a gigantic sofa into a tiny living room. Instead, try to find appropriate furnishings that do not overwhelm the room and still give you room to breathe.",
            "An important trick is mirrors, which simply make the room feel larger and more inviting. In certain places, they can stretch the entire room and also provide a special detail. It is clever to install mirrors in a smallbathroomor hallway—the reflection gives the room a few more square metres.",
            "While we're on the subject of mirrors, you could also consider using this trick in the bedroom. Mirrored doors in the wardrobe could easily make the room appear larger.",
            "Sometimes the space in small apartments has to be used with other ideas. For example, if you have an open kitchen area that not only leads into the dining area but also the living room, you should get a room divider. Of course, this doesn't necessarily have to be a solid wall. Instead, opt for a bright and modern room divider like the one in the picture—this not only ensures privacy in the kitchen and living room but can also be used as a shelf.",
            "People living in small apartments often suffer from a lack of space. There aren't enough cupboards and dressers in the rooms, so you have to think outside the box and use the space you have available. You can find storage space under the stairs, for example, or in bare corners and closed doors or windows. Take a look at your apartment with this in mind—you're guaranteed to find at least one place that can be wonderfully converted into new storage space. Let the ideas in this article inspire you!",
            "And if it's not storage space that you're looking for, but rather additional space, then you should still take a closer look at the area under the stairs! Here, you can easily set up a modern study, as in this picture, that takes up little space and gives you enough quiet to work successfully on your projects.",
            "It is also important that you keep your apartment tidy and clean. Get rid of the chaos in the entrance area and hallway and you will see that even this small room will appear much larger if it is equipped with a wardrobe and a shoe cabinet.",
            "If you doubt that you can fit everything into the small kitchen, you should simply invest in practical shelving systems that allow you to use the entire wall. In this picture, you can see that the space on the wall has been used up to the top, not only in terms of the shelves but also for thewashing machine and dryer—this means that the floor space in the room remains almost untouched and the kitchen appears spacious despite the small size.",
            "Finally, a tip on wall colour: If you have a small apartment, you should avoid crazy colour combinations and instead go for simple and light wall colours. Nothing makes a room appear larger than bright white, which is more than clear from the huge living room in this picture. Askinterior designersfor tips, they can give you individual advice on your apartment and help you to make each room appear larger!",

            "If living space in your own house is becoming scarce, but a new extension, basement or attic conversion is out of the question, there is often only one option left to create new perspectives and additional space for living: a garage conversion. Old garages are increasingly being integrated into living spaces and converted into bedrooms, kitchens, guest rooms, etc. However, there are a lot of things to consider, both technically and legally.",
            "",
            "If you want to integrate your garage into your home or convert it into a living space that can be used in all weather conditions, you have to equip it with completely new insulation, radiators and electricity. Warm water should also be available—depending on the intended use. This project can be quite complicated, especially when it comes to insulation because garages often have a heat requirement that is many times higher than normal residential buildings due to their anything-but-optimal surface-to-volume ratio and: The low room height can make it difficult to insulate the floor.",
            "A very important point when converting a garage is new entrances and the provision of natural light. The old garage door has to be removed and the remaining opening is bricked up and provided with a door. In addition, new window openings are necessary if the formergarageis now to be used as an attractive living space. By the way: Old garage doors usually sell well. Depending on the condition and model, the resale value is between 200 and 900 euros.",
            "Before you even think about aspects such as windows, doors, insulation and power supply, you should deal with the legal side of garage conversion. German building law sets strict limits for builders for any type of conversion or expansion, although these can vary considerably from state to state. If you want to avoid unpleasant surprises and legal consequences, you must go the official route and submit a building application to the responsible authority.",
            "For which extensions and conversions do I need a building permit?",
            "From insulation to the power supply and from water pipes to windows and doors – a garage conversion like this can be quite complex and therefore expensive. It is therefore advisable to make precise calculations before construction begins and to consider all eventualities, including the interior work andinterior design.",
            "Of course, it is important to think carefully about how the new additional living space will be used before the renovation. Based on this, you can then plan whether window openings are really necessary, whether the extension is already provided with enough daylight through an opening to the house, whether you need running water in this part of the house and where the electrical cables should run.",
            "An architect can help you if you need ideas on how you can convert your garage and integrate it into your living space.",
            "Do you also have a house or apartment with a garage? More and more people, especially in the city, are deciding against owning a car and would rather expand their garage instead. If you also want to insulate the freed-up space in a garage and then use it, this article would certainly be of interest to you.",
            "You have already received some tips and ideas on how you can plan and implement the conversion of your garage. There are many creative ways to build and furnish an extraordinary garage. No matter how you want to expand your garage, the new living space will pay off.",
            "As already mentioned, don’t forget to check all legal aspects before you start construction work. You should only convert a garage once you have a building permit—otherwise, it can be expensive."

But sometimes thekitchenis tiny and there's barely enough space to store everything, and then you also want a table that can seat two or three people.",
            "For us, almost nothing is impossible, thanks to our professionalkitchen planners.Since we know that dealing withsmall kitchenscan be a big issue, today, we want to present you with 10 designs that have managed to integrate a counter despite their small dimensions.",
            "Do you want to upgrade your kitchen and dining room with a modern counter? We think: Yes, you should! A counter in the kitchen is practical on the one hand and a real eye-catcher on the other. If you are interested in planning and implementing a counter, you should take a look at our idea book. Here you will find great ideas and valuable inspiration for installing a greatcountereven in small kitchens. A counter also provides a nice separation between the living room and dining room. Our kitchen planners have put together a few really beautiful counters for modern kitchens below. Be inspired by the models made of wood, stone and other materials. Your cool counter is then complemented by the matching bar stools and great decorations and accessories.",
            "What a special kitchen! Framed in exposed concrete and open pipes, the colourful kitchen cabinets are particularly striking. The grey stone worktop charmingly extends the kitchen counter around the corner. So you sit in the kitchen area, but the bar still represents a unit in itself. Puristic wooden stools create the connection between the ultra-modern kitchen and the cosy parquet floor.",
            "This counter exudes a very modern design with its stainless steel worktop. But thanks to the many wooden elements in the kitchen, at the dining table and the elegant wooden floor, the counter does not appear too cold but invites you to take a seat. The black bar stools are ultra-modern and harmonize wonderfully with the industrial-looking hanging lamps.",
            "This kitchen was planned in a U-shape, but it is open on two sides. The minimalist design of the pure white high-gloss kitchen can be shown off beautifully. To create space for the residents, a long, narrow bar was installed around two sides of the U-shape. Six designer chairs in bright red provide a cheerful contrast in the otherwise white kitchen.",
            "A touch of light green: This minimalist white kitchen seems to have been breathed into existence, it makes such a light impression. Here too, the kitchen and worktop were planned in a U-shaped design. The counter is again the extended arm of the worktop. On two cool mint green stools, the residents can look directly into the interior of the kitchen. Communication between the chef and the guests is no problem. The funny thing is the stylish refrigerator, which picks up the mint green of the stools on the opposite side.",
            "In thissmall kitchen,we come across wooden elements that give the kitchen a rustic design. Our kitchen planners only designed the worktop in white. There is even room for four bar stools made of a combination of leather and wood at the long counter, which almost looks like a small pub counter, doesn't it?",
            "This blue and white kitchen is also U-shaped. However, our experts have solved the integration of this dining table differently. The white minimalist table extends the U-shape here too but was deliberately placed lower so that we have a classic table with two dining chairs. The small drinks fridge next to the dining table is funny. Three hanging lamps illuminate the table generously.",
            "In the next example, we look at a kitchen that has a classic, homely design. Due to the lack of space, our kitchen planners simply brought the largedining tableinto the kitchen—and placed part of the worktop with the hob on top of it. The white-painted wooden tabletop offers a wonderful, warm contrast to the wooden table. The upholstered designer chairs exude a classy touch.",
            "Pure romance! This kitchen shows its playful side. Due to the lack of space, our experts simply installed the dining table in the kitchen. Together with four bar stools, you can have breakfast in front of the large window. The white lacquered kitchen cabinets with a nostalgic touch offer a great contrast to the worktop in lacquered natural wood.",
            "Admittedly, this kitchen is not small. But we thought the integration of the counter was so nice that we didn't want to withhold it from anyone. This kitchen is presented in the beautiful beach house style that we find mainly in the north of Germany or on the Frisian Islands. White kitchen furniture combined with warm wooden elements such as the worktop and wooden floor creates a great unit.",
            "Now it continues completely asymmetrically! Because everything in this kitchen is different from what we are used to. Our kitchen planners simply installed two counters—not only at different heights but also in different shapes. While the rear bar is triangular, where you can sit on one side, the lower table is oval. Three more stools can be placed here. We think: A kitchen with a mysterious, masculine touch.",
            "We want to end our tour with a modern kitchen design. Because there was very little space for a table, our experts only integrated a small table with two chairs. But that is more than enough for a small meal in between. Even if you don't need the bar, it is a great eye-catcher for every day, together with the red hanging lights and a few fresh flowers from the garden!"

            "Once mould has appeared in our house, there can be many reasons for it and sometimes, the search for it is like looking for a needle in a haystack. Usually, several factors at once lead to an infestation.",
            "- Sometimes our rooms are too damp simply because they have not been properly ventilated. The humidity in the room should not exceed 55 per cent, because then moisture will settle on the ceilings, walls or windows and provide an ideal breeding ground for mould. That is why we should ventilate our rooms several times a day with the window open. In this way, we exchange the air inside and outside. Incidentally, we should be particularly careful when it comes to ventilation in summer. Because then the outside temperature itself is high, which we bring into the house if we keep the window open. This is especially true for old cellars, which should be ventilated generously in winter and not at all in summer.",
            "- Not all paints are the same and not all plasters are the same. We should ask professionalpaintersdirectly which paints and plasters can absorb or release moisture within a certain range. The differences here are very big.",
            "- Sometimes our furniture is simply too close to a wall. As a rule, there should be at least a 5-centimetre gap between the piece of furniture and the outside wall so that the air can circulate. This is especially true for kitchens and bathrooms.",
            "The aesthetic question is the one that concerns us. But much more important is the question of what an infestation does to our health. We spend a lot of time within our four walls. That is why the rooms should be in perfect condition to support our well-being.",
            "Mould can cause severe breathing problems, respiratory allergies and a higher level of infections—especially in children, the elderly or those residents who are prone to allergies or asthma. Headaches, tiredness and weakness can also sometimes be associated with mold. If in doubt, ask an expert in the field for advice. They usually look at a building thoroughly and take laboratory samples that provide information about possible infestation.",
            "We should never take mould infestation lightly. Because the spores can easily spread to other rooms in the house once they have arrived. Therefore, if you have a large infestation or are unsure, it is best to ask a professional for advice. Some home remedies can help prevent an infestation or get minor mould infestations under control:",
            "- Lemon can work wonders, especially in the bathroom, creating cleanliness and a hygienic environment. Tiles can be cleaned well with lemon juice in water.",
            "- Baking soda mixed with water or vinegar is also a proven household remedy for weekly cleaning without chemical additives. We should make sure to thoroughly clean the clothes used and change the water frequently.",
            "- Saltwater is ideal for clothing that has mould stains.",
            "- There are many cleaners on the market that can be used specifically to combat mould. However, they only combat mould that is on the surface offurniture,walls or tiles. Our tip: always wear a respiratory mask and gloves, ventilate the area well and keep children away from the activity.",
            "In particular, underground cellar rooms often have a very different climate than those on the ground or upper floors. Old buildings in particular, which do not have comprehensive insulation from the ground, often have problems with high humidity. If the cellar is uninhabited and only contains rooms such as a wine cellar, the climate is not a problem. However, such places are not suitable for storing sensitive materials such as cardboard or clothing. Special ventilation systems can then help to ensure optimal ventilation here. When we are dealing with rising dampness, the plaster often crumbles from the wall. Insulating materials such as renovation plaster or material that is inserted into the wall can then help to solve the problem.",
            "After removing the mould, the problem reoccurs after a few weeks. If that is the case, no commercially available products will help. Then the cause lies deeper. In the case of walls or ceilings, for example, this can mean a problem with the external insulation, leaky pipes or structural problems in the house that lead to excessive humidity. Dehumidifiers can also help temporarily. But you should still ask a specialist for an assessment. Because in the end, mould also reduces the value of the house."

Of course, you should leave the planning of such a terrace toprofessionalswho have an eye on the complicated static requirements, but when it comes todesign,we can get creative ourselves. We have put together six cool ideas for you that will turn your flat roof into an outdoor paradise.",
            "Do you already have a flat roof or maybe even a roof terrace? Then you should read through our tips and tricks for designing cool roof terraces in this idea book. But even if you are planning the construction, you might want to build a flat roof. This is a pretty cool way to create more living space. If not done when building a new house, the roof terrace can also be built afterwards. In this context, we will show you how impressively a roof terrace can beautify a flat roof and thus the whole house. Let our ideas inspire you and consider having a roof terrace built on a flat roof. You will certainly not regret building a roof terrace.",
            "Whether it's blazing sun, nasty wind or drizzle—on the roof terrace you are often exposed to the weather without protection. If you want to convert your flat roof into a dream terrace that you can use without problems for more than just 5 days out of 365, you should take appropriate precautions—ideally in the form of roofs, awnings or other coverings that reliably provide shade, protect against drafts and give rain clouds the cold shoulder.",
            "The right floor covering plays an important role on the roof terrace, as it should be weatherproof, easy to clean, durable and robust, but of course, also look good. When planning, it is also important to ensure that the substructure is sufficiently ventilated and that no water can penetrate the living space below. So you should not cut corners here and opt for high-quality and professional installation.",
            "For most of us, a terrace without plants is unimaginable. The same applies, of course, to the flat roof, which is to be transformed into a paradisiacal roof terrace. There are numerous options here: from classic planters and flower pots to modern raised beds and vertical gardens to real lawns and vegetable beds, anything you like is possible above and on the roofs of the city. It is best to plan the green roof garden together with an experienced professional.",
            "A pool or jacuzzi on the roof is an absolute dream that many homeowners would like to fulfil. While a real swimming pool on the roof terrace can rarely be implemented without great effort due to static conditions, lack of space and financial issues, things are much easier with a jacuzzi. And who wouldn't want to enjoy the view of the starry sky and the sea of lights of the city in their jacuzzi?",
            "An important part of every terrace is, of course, thefurniture.Roof terraces in particular can be easily transformed into cosy lounge areas with comfortable seating due to their size. From loungers to sofas and outdoor beds to hammocks—whatever you like and what fits your budget is allowed. Our tip: For a cheaper but no less cool lounge option, simply use trendy pallet furniture.",
            "We end our book of ideas with a roof terrace that has the complete package: from the protective roof to the easy-care floor, plants and comfortable furniture to the magnificent view, nothing is left to be desired here. The highlight is the outdoor kitchen with grill and oven, which guarantees culinary revelations in this terrace paradise."

The idea book contains useful tips on choosing the balcony railing. You will also find information on the costs and care of the selected materials. The maintenance of the balcony railing generally depends on the properties and characteristics of the material.",

            "High-quality larch wood does not need to be treated. The purchase price for a balcony railing is between €80 and €150 per linear metre.",
            "Douglas fir is considered tough and durable. It is very strong and yet remains fairly coarse-grained. European woods are generally a little softer than American varieties.",
            "If the quality is good, you don't need to paint your Douglas fir balcony railing. Douglas fir is often a slightly cheaper alternative to larch.",
            "Wood has a natural charm. The material is ideal for designing balconies in innovative passive houses and classic old buildings. Maintenance and care costs are relatively high.",
            "The railing should be sanded down and repainted every 5 to 10 years. However, since rainwater runs off the cladding well, the wood is less exposed to the weather than the wood flooring.",

            "Downspout: What is it? The gutter is a construction element that has the function of collecting rainwater that runs down the roofs so that it does not come into contact with the walls. This element helps to protect the structure of the house against possible wear caused by water and, at the same time, to use rainwater by running it into reservoirs.",
            "This is an essential element for the preservation of buildings, as it helps them to remain protected from the aggression of humidity. The deterioration caused by water may not be immediately visible and, therefore, may not seem significant, but in fact, when it becomes noticeable it has already caused a lot of damage. Water infiltration into building structures causes extensive damage that costs a fortune to repair.",
            "That being said, it is essential to install downspouts to ensure the integrity of your home. Whatever you can spend now, you'll be saving yourself worry, lack of comfort and costly repair costs in the future.",
            "",
            "The first thing to do before installing the gutter is to decide which one gives the best answer to what you want. There are gutters in various types of material, each of which has advantages and disadvantages that you should know about before choosing.",
            "Below we show you the most popular options.",
            "Due to the characteristics of its material (plastic), the PVC downspout is among the cheapest options in the market, both in terms of product and installation prices. Despite being cheap, these downspouts are durable and resistant to certain damages caused by contact with natural elements and do not allow themselves to corrode. They also have the advantage of being available in the market in various colours, so it is easy to make them fit into a home.",
            "On the other hand, despite being durable, they are not as resistant as downspouts made of any type of metal. This lower resistance implies, for example, a greater need for maintenance and regular cleaning so that, as a result of the accumulation of debris, the material does not break or dismantle. Furthermore, despite the wide palette of colours available, this is not the prettiest material. If you want to opt for a gutter that enhances the building from an aesthetic point of view, look for other materials.",
            "Zinc downspouts are very resistant to rust and any other type of wear and corrosion caused by the weather. Due to its quality and composition, the lifespan of this material is quite long (it can reach 50 years) and the maintenance requirement is low, which ends up compensating, in a certain way, for the higher initial price, making this type of downspout a quite common choice.",
            "If, on the other hand, we are dealing with an extremely resistant and reliable element, it is also true that we can expect a much higher budget. Its installation is also more complex and must be carried out byprofessionals.This is a material that contracts or expands according to temperature changes, making its installation process more intricate and rigorous. Furthermore, it is worth remembering that this material is vulnerable to acid runoff from cedar wood roofs, as well as to saltpetre common in environments close to the sea.",
            "Aluminium downspouts are very resistant to weathering, rust and rot, making them a good solution for areas with adverse weather conditions. This resistance capacity means they last much longer (around 20 years) than PVC, although shorter than zinc. Furthermore, it is a material that is available in various colours, making it easy to acquire the ideal tone for your home.",
            "On the other hand, aluminium, being a material with little flexibility, can become dented quite easily. These damages, although they do not impede its proper functioning and effectiveness, make the element less beautiful and, depending on the dimensions, may even require some type of repair. As with the zinc option, aluminium downspouts also tend to contract or expand with changes in the weather, which requires greater installation care to avoid water infiltration. Finally, although they are available in a wide colour palette, we must bear in mind that their colour is normally achieved through a layer of enamel. This means that, over time, the paint will crack and peel, requiring new paintwork with some frequency.",
            "Stainless steel or stainless steel downspouts are extremely resistant and, unlike other metal options, will maintain their shine and initial beauty for a long time. This type of material is resistant to adverse climate conditions and, therefore, does not damage, break, bend or wear out, whether in extreme heat or cold. This is a long-lasting material that, as a result of its chemical composition, remains free from rust and other signs of corrosion for a long time.",
            "Despite these advantages, it is worth mentioning that it is a very heavy material and, therefore, difficult to work with. You will need a team of professionals to carry out its installation. Furthermore, it is an expensive material which, taking into account that its durability is much greater than that of aluminium, may cause some doubts as to the benefits of its use.",
            "Taking into account the importance of this structure in the security of a home, we strongly recommend that you hire professionals with experience carrying out this work. We realize that, after spending a lot of money on materials, it may seem tempting to save on installation and try to tackle the project without the help of third parties. However, unless you have professional training and the appropriate materials for this, don't do it. What you are saving on installation could end up spending double (or more) on repairing damage caused not only to the gutter but also to the structure of the house itself. Therefore, we suggest that you look for a company in the area that guarantees work with high quality and safety standards, a worry-free process and the guarantee that any future problem will be resolved.",
            "As we can see, the lifespan of a gutter depends on the material, but the average is between 20 and 30 years, depending on the climatic conditions of each region and maintenance care.",
            "Here are the six most common problems:",
            "This is one of the main problems. When debris accumulates and begins to decompose, it creates a “sheet” of solid dirt that clogs the gutter. Accumulated rubbish dangerously increases the risk of fire and is extremely harmful to the roof, which begins to wear out and trap water in the tiles themselves. To prevent this problem from occurring, it is important to clean your gutters twice a year: in autumn (because of the leaves) and at the end of spring (because of the rain).",
            "Sagging gutters",
            "The weight of debris can also cause gutters to fall, usually because the material used to hold the components cannot withstand the additional weight. In addition to cleaning, the gutters that make up the downspout must be well-secured and without gaps between them.",
            "If you see that there is water coming out between the gutters, then there may be a hole causing the leak. In this case, you must repair it quickly so that it does not enlarge. In a construction and DIY store, look for the gutter sealant to caulk the gutter. Larger holes will need to be recommended. To do this, it must be the same material as the gutter, as a different material can cause erosion.",
            "Inadequate slope",
            "If the idea is for water to flow, the gutter must be placed at the right angle. If the gutter is clean and water still accumulates in it, then the slope is not correct. Sometimes this problem is solved with some adjustments, but it may be necessary to remove the gutter and install it again, which is much more work.",
            "Damage tends to occur due to the action of the weather. A strong storm or wind could be enough to knock down the gutter. Then, depending on the condition it is in, it may simply be necessary to replace it or it may have to be replaced, partially or completely. Once again, we emphasize that professional installation is crucial to avoid these problems.",
            "The average price for installing and maintaining a downspout is around 400 euros but can go up to close to 1300 euros, depending on the material used and what this implies in terms of installation. We recommend asking for several quotes so that you can compare what each company offers you and thus be able to make the decision that best suits you. We note, however, that you must make a decision based on what seems to be the proposal with the best quality/price ratio, even if it is not the cheapest.",
            "Here on ourwebsite, you can find professionals and companies in the area that work in your area of residence. Look for references in the sections:roofs, pipes,buildersandconstruction materials. These professionals are the best people to advise and help you regarding materials, prices and installation."

They look imposing and at the same time, they also make you feel confused because the existing interior suddenly seems to be insignificant. But you can counteract this. To do this, you need to show a little sensitivity and incorporate a little creativity into your planning. There are various ways to create comfort in larger rooms. You can achieve this, for example, with appropriatewalldesigns, either by using wallpaper with motifs, hanging pictures or sticking special tattoos on the wall. You can of course also get artistic yourself and design motifs yourself and draw them on the wall. In addition, with larger rooms, you should also pay attention to the materials you want to use in the rooms. Individual materials appear cool, while surfaces made of wood or with a wood look radiate a certain warmth.",

These measures can be designed in different ways and do not require a lot of effort in terms of subsequent installation. When furnishing larger rooms, do not focus on how they may appear to outsiders, but primarily ensure that you enjoy being in the rooms and feel comfortable. Always keep in mind that your own four walls are the central point for you and your family. You spend your free time in them and relax from everyday life. Living spaces should reflect your personality. Take enough time to find appropriate suggestions that suit both you and your ideas. Inspiration can be found almost every day and on every corner if you keep your eyes open.",
            "Designing large rooms requires a delicate touch and a good eye. The room should not be cluttered and should not look like a museum or a reception hall. By using the rightfurnitureand accessories, you can also decorate a large room attractively and create a harmonious image. Today we will show you a few helpful tips from ourinterior designerson how you can decorate your spacious and large living room or other rooms. Decorating a large living room or making a large living room cosy is not that difficult with a few tips.",
            "Large rooms can be a real challenge when it comes to creating a cosy atmosphere. However, this only seems very complex at first glance. There are numerous suggestions for creating a cosy atmosphere. Large furniture looks very bulky and takes away the room's visual dominance.",
            "When choosing large furniture, you should also pay attention to the colour properties. Brown tones have a cosy effect and do not darken the room too much. Accents can be set tastefully by using carpets that create contrasts. But here too, you should pay attention to warm colours so that the overall atmosphere appears calm and gentle. Pastel tones or cream colours can often support this effect, as they greatly facilitate colour transitions.",
            "In addition to a warm design of the walls and floor, accessories are also among the elements that make a large room feel cosy. Particular attention is not always paid to attractive curtains, but also to details that immediately catch the eye but are overlooked.",
            "For example, use sofa sets that are covered in textiles. At the same time, you can tastefully decorate the upholstered furniture with attractive cushions. You can also use pictures and carpets that have a positive effect on the room climate. However, you don't have to base the design of your rooms exclusively on textiles. However, since they have an inviting effect, they should be taken into account in every step of your room design.",
            "Larger rooms have a very elegant appearance and allow for generous division and use of the space. However, they are not easy to handle in some respects. You will notice this at the latest when it comes to creating a cosy atmosphere. If you have carefully chosen your new home, then the architecture may favour your plans.",
            "Large rooms that have a rustic look or wooden beams make it much easier to create a cosy atmosphere. If you can't enjoy the benefits of wooden beams in the walls and ceiling, you can use wallpaper to make them look better. You can also give the floor a wooden look. Wood has a warm effect and creates a pleasant and inviting atmosphere.",
            "With larger rooms, you get more flexibility, which makes furnishing much easier. You can design the rooms more loosely and combine furnishing styles, even if they look completely different. In addition, you can place attractive pictures, which not only act as an elegant eye-catcher but also create a certain cosiness in large rooms.",
            "Pictures not only create a cosy atmosphere in larger rooms, but at the same time, they look very elegant and give the room a dignified flair that invites you to linger. They are an eye-catcher that makes it difficult for the viewer to ignore the effect. Rounded off with an impressive sofa, this way, conversations can take place in a cosy atmosphere.",
            "Large rooms can be decorated comfortably if you dare to let your imagination run wild. It is even easier if you also take your personality into account when decorating. Why not let your favourite colours become the theme of the entire room? In coordination with different elements, this can lead to impressive results.",
            "Use your favourite colour as a base and look for a matching accent. After that, all you need is the intuition to combine the colours appealingly and subtly. This doesn't necessarily have to be complicated if, for example, you choose wallpaper in the corresponding colours and match accessories such as cushions and curtains to the colours. However, the impressive overall picture only unfolds if the base colour dominates the room and the contrast surrounds your favourite colour.",
            "Large rooms appear very bulky at first glance, especially if they are not yet furnished. At the same time, in this state, they also allow a sober view of the possibilities available to you. The first question that arises is how to create cosiness in a room of this size.",
            "The solutions are very diverse and range from floor, ceiling and wall design to lighting and attractive accessories. But especially in empty rooms, you have the option of installing a partition wall or a room divider. This ensures a visual reduction in the realistic space available. In addition, you can concentrate on one half and furnish it in a homely manner and according to your ideas."

Nevertheless, with a few tricks and tips, you can get the most out of the existing bathroom, make it completely more beautiful and give it a personal and individual touch. With the following nine tips, every rented bathroom becomes an oasis of well-being.",
            "Of course, the bathroom is not necessarily the room you like to clean the most. Especially not if the previous tenant lived there until recently. But we have no other choice: If we want to turn a bathroom that is still unfamiliar into our very own personal oasis of well-being, we need a thorough clean—from the ceiling to the floor. It is worth it because afterwards, we feel much more comfortable in the new bathroom.",
            "Check out this idea book,design hacks to maximise space in small bathrooms.",
            "A new shower curtain works wonders when it comes to beautifying the bathroom in your rented apartment and giving it a personal touch. Brightly coloured or subtly plain, with or without a pattern, romantically playful, minimalistic or crazy—it's not the landlord who decides, but our taste.",
            "The toilet in a rented apartment is a tricky thing… But when it comes to the toilet seat, we have a lot of leeway. If it's too old, too dirty or just not our style, we can swap it for something nicer.",
            "As a tenant, you generally don't have much freedom when it comes to choosing the tiles in your bathroom. Either you're lucky and find neutral white or a cool design that suits your taste, or you're unlucky. But even in this case, you can find a solution—with tile stickers that are easy to apply and just as easy to remove.",
            "If you want to make your rented bathroom even more comfortable with a little luxury and comfort, you can buy a new shower head for a little money. The old one can be easily replaced, but you should keep it in a safe place so that you can screw it back on just as easily when you move out.",
            "Storage space is often scarce in renters' bathrooms. Fortunately, numerous great and practical solutions don't require drilling holes in the walls or investing a fortune. Freely placeable wall shelves, hanging baskets, hooks that stick to the wall and rolling containers are functional helpers that reliably store our things.",
            "We feel most comfortable in rooms with personalities that say something about the person who lives there. In a rented apartment, you just have to know how to help yourself. If you can't choose the bathroom furnishings, you at least have the opportunity to give the room a personal touch with the appropriate decorations. Photos and pictures, souvenirs from trips, a certaincolourscheme or a theme that suits us (for exampleOrient,BeachorAsia Spa) as well as selected small details with charm and character can help.",
            "Another update in the bathroom is plants. They not only ensure a good room climate but also round off anyinterior designin an atmospheric way.",
            "Room fragrances for the bathroom are always a good idea. Whether in the form of scented candles, oils, room sprays or diffusers, it's all up to your taste."

Floor plans with as few walls as possible, in which the individual functional areas flow seamlessly into one another, are more popular than ever. Despite all the spaciousness, a certain structure and privacy should of course be maintained. For this purpose, creative room divider solutions come into play, which separates individual areas from one another and ensures order and clarity. Today, ourinterior designers and decoratorsare devoting themselves to the question of which ideas can be used to separate the living area from the entrance area.",
            "Shelves are one of the most popular room dividers because, on the one hand, they create clear boundaries, but on the other hand they allow views and, above all, they let light in.

            "Slowly but surely, it is no longer possible to deny that summer with its short, mild nights is finally over. Autumn has arrived, jackets and coats are hanging in our wardrobes again, and winter is slowly making its way onto the shoe rack.",
            "To protect yourself as best as possible against the cold, wet temperatures and the dwindling daylight, the need to design and decorate your house or apartment as comfortably as possible arises, especially in autumn and winter. With the help of ourinterior designers and decorators,we will show you tricks to achieve this quickly and effectively!",
            "Crackling fire, cosy atmosphere. Anyone who buys a fireplace for theirliving roomis well on their way to turning their living room into a cosy lounge. Fireplaces not only heat the room temperature but also the atmosphere in it, bathing the living room in a warm glow and increasing the cosy and feel-good factor enormously. Especially now that the transition to the cold season is imminent, using the fireplace is an external and internal benefit. Staring into the fire stimulates the flow of thoughts—you can relax and be lulled by the radiating warmth.",
            "Tip: Open fireplaces increase thecosyfeeling even more.",
            "Of course, you don't want to become a couch potato, but you shouldn't do without a cosy central point in the living room. Even if the environment already seems very homely thanks to soft textiles, warm colours and decorations, the sofa can sometimes be the only piece of furniture in the living room that also makes you feel physically comfortable. If there is enough space, this naturally also extends to chaise longues, loveseats and other armchair-like furniture. The design doesn't have to hide behind the function of comfort. Both can be wonderfully combined these days.",
            "Even though it usually seems cold, a leather sofa in a warm brown tone can become a real centrepiece of cosiness in the living room. Take a look at this idea book,19 smart ideas to create cosy interiors in your home.",
            "The height of comfort, however, is an extremely deep sofa seat, where you can put your feet up in an instant without even taking up space from your neighbour. Ideal for cosy Sunday afternoons while it's storming and snowing outside. Maybe even in front of an open fire?",
            "This corner sofa is guaranteed to become your new favourite spot in the living room. And the best part: It even has a sleeping function, which means it can be transformed into a comfortable bed in no time at all when you have overnight guests.",
            "Soft textiles look exactly like they do: warm and sometimes cosy. The great thing about textiles is that they are wonderfully unobtrusive and increase the cosiness factor of any living room without much drama. They seem more like a connection betweenfurnitureand accessories.",
            "These include carpets in particular, which can have a major impact on the atmosphere in your home. Beyond the floor, there are windows, which can be fashionably accentuated with the help of curtains and, thanks to their relatively low cost, can be replaced as often as you like. You can also add curtains or just choose one of these decorative elements.",
            "Another classic is adding pillows in all shapes and colours, and they certainly contribute the most to cosiness. Depending on the style of your living room, you can choose pillowcases made of different fabrics and with different patterns or as a colourful accent, or you can make them yourself.",
            "Tables also fall into this category. Depending on the colour and size, however, they can quickly turn out to be a dominant eye-catcher. In addition, the choice of fabric and pattern for upholstered furniture can also influence the comfortable living environment.",
            "Warm colours act as a contrast to the wintry tones outside and transform the living room into a cosy place. While it looks bare and dreary behind the glass, the living room is enlivened by intense colours from orange to brown to red. If you prefer your furniture in neutral tones, you can also bring warm colours into the living room using textiles such as cushions or lampshades. You can also add targeted splashes of colour with the help of accessories. You don't have to use only warm tones. A beautiful blue or a soft violet can bring excitement and variety to the room.",
            "If you follow the biological rhythm of plants, you can theoretically decorate your apartment or house with flowering potted plants all year round. Alternatively, it is of course worth visiting a florist to bring the special flair of the seasons into your home. But the classic green potted plant or the charismatic cactus also add decorative accents to the living room ambience. Especially if the plant itself is rather plain, you can let your imagination run wild when choosing the vase or flowerpot. But it doesn't matter which flower or plant you choose. The fact is that they bring harmony into the living room and, as a healthy side effect, also ensure a better indoor climate. Especially in the living room, where you often spend several hours with several people, plants not only have a calming but also arefreshingeffect. There are even plants that can improve the air particularly quickly.",
            "When it comes to decoration, there is often a fine line between comfort and disorder—especially in the living room, as it is the most used room, and people tend to overload it. After all, you want to have all your memories, beloved accessories and travel souvenirs within sight and at eye level. But here too, less is more. This is not to say that bare walls are the new comfort. Instead, you should concentrate on individual, distinctive decorative items or place a few larger accessories rather than many small ones. This could be, for example, a picture with a striking frame around it, a large clock, a sailboat, a row of books or a table lamp.",
            "The classic mood maker: candles in all possible shapes, colours and styles. They spread comfort and the scent of cinnamon, especially at Christmas time, and can also create a romantic atmosphere in the evenings the rest of the year. Similar to a fireplace, candles bathe the living room in a soft, warm light, albeit in a smaller but equally effective style. Who can't relax immediately with so much cosiness in the living room? Whether a mix of styles or a series, in different sizes, whether classic or unusual, candles and their holders inevitably exude romantic charm and create a cosy ambience."

            "As a piece of furniture, a shoe cabinet is often underestimated and only perceived as functional. But it is often in thehallwayand entrance and is one of the first pieces of furniture that guests and you see. And if you believe the cliché, only women need a shoe cabinet to store their huge amounts of shoes. This cliché has long since ceased to correspond to reality. Because let's be honest, men also need a way to put their shoes out of sight—and families in particular. Shoe cabinets and shelves ensure that the entrance area remains free of shoe chaos, because most of the time all the shoes are standing next to each other and stacked on top of each other, just looking unsightly. The fact that the shoe cabinet not only has to serve a purpose, but can also look decorative, is shown by the following shoe storage ideas, which can range from classic to unusual.",
            "PS: You might need to hire aprofessional carpenterfor these ideas.",
            "This model shows how you can easily bring order to your home and eliminate shoe chaos. More than 20 pairs of shoes can be stored neatly in a row. The slim design means the shoe cabinet can easily be placed in a small hallway and reinforces the tidy overall impression. If you choose it with colored cabinet doors, it will be livened up a bit and won't be as boring as a conventional shoe cabinet.",
            "Another good idea for storing shoes in a space-saving way is to attach angled shelves to the wall. Not only does this look stylish, but the openness of the shelves also puts the shoes in the spotlight.",
            "If you have a lot of boots and ankle boots in your shoe collection, boot panels can help. If boots and ankle boots are on the floor, it usually looks very chaotic, but the storage option with the panels makes it quick and easy to organize the shoes. If they are attached to the wall in the hallway, the wall should not be too narrow, as they can then take up too much space.",
            "8 Storage Solutions for Every Need.",
            "If you don't want to store your shoes in a closed cupboard in the back corner, open cupboards are the way to go. Some shoes are just too beautiful to be hidden in dark cupboards or squeezed next to other shoes. This way you can proudly display them and they will have an impact not only when worn on your feet.",
            "What is more reminiscent of a wall bar from school days is a great way to organize your shoes in a space-saving way. Especially for small hallways, this is another way to create flexible space for your shoes. It is also a very original and fun alternative to the conventional shoe cabinet. Who would suspect that this is a shoe cabinet? But that is precisely what makes it original and makes it a real eye-catcher.",
            "If you would rather keep your shoes out of sight, you can easily integrate your shoe cabinet into your wardrobe. This way, no shoe cabinet takes up space in the hallway and everything is still nicely organized. If you want to show off your favorite pieces, you can do so with individual pairs using other storage options mentioned here.",
            "If you have a whole dressing room , you can easily store them there and keep them out of the guests' sight. This also saves the space needed for a separate shoe cabinet in the hallway.",
            "For the elegant version, this model offers everything your heart desires. It comes in a trendy vintage look and is a real eye-catcher. Its wooden compartments also offer plenty of space for your personal shoe collection.",
            "For those who like something unusual, this metal cabinet is worth considering. Shoe cabinets and wardrobes don't always have to match, but can look stylish just because they look different. An old metal locker was simply converted into a shoe cabinet. Not only does it look super stylish, it also serves its purpose more than satisfactorily. You certainly won't find a shoe cabinet like this in anyone else's home anytime soon.",
            "The idea of a shoe cabinet inside the wall is both really cool and crazy. On the one hand, this idea really saves space and at the same time shows off your favorite pieces. You won't find a shoe cabinet like this in any other apartment any time soon.",
            "There are also a few great ideas for storing children's shoes. This shoe cabinet is a mix of a bench and a shoe rack. The rounded corners and edges are very child-friendly and the curves give the whole thing an elegant and classy touch. It looks particularly good in a child's room or hallway.",
            "Especially for children, it can be something cute and funny. A wooden shoe cabinet is ideal for this, perhaps in the shape of the child's favorite animal.",
            "Most people probably have a shoe cabinet like this in their hallway or apartment. The shoe rack is so popular because it saves a lot of space and can even fit in the narrowest hallway.",
            "If you're a real shoe lover and own a few really valuable pieces, you'll naturally want to show them off. Placed next to each other on a kind of pedestal, the shoes will attract everyone's attention. And if they're well lit, they look even more classy.",
            "For individualists with a sense of humor, this type of shoe cabinet offers a fun solution for organizing shoes and saving space at the same time. At first glance, you would hardly think it's a shoe cabinet, but that's exactly what makes it so charming.",
            "Nowadays, it no longer has to be the boring classic shoe cabinet that every second person has in their apartment. Sure, it offers a great way to save space and put shoes out of the way, and is certainly the right thing to start with. However, if you want to add style and charm to your interior, you should think about the different storage options. There are now numerous stylish, funny, elegant and luxurious versions of shoe cabinets, so everyone can find what they are looking for. They all fulfill their function, but not all of them are eye-catchers and can beautify the interior of the apartment."

            "You only notice doors in yourliving roomwhen they stop working properly. Most of the time, you take them for granted. But they're annoying when they creak, squeak, don't close properly, open on their own, or drag across the floor. We all know what it's like, the problem is ignored until someone else takes care of it or you drive yourself crazy.",
            "It is normal for the doors in your house or apartment to develop one or two problems sooner or later. This is partly due to the frequency of use, such as in the living room, but also to the material and humidity. Often small mistakes are made during installation that need to be ironed out later.",
            "In most cases, however, you can save yourself the trouble of calling in aprofessional.We can repair the broken doors in our house easily by ourselves in just a few steps. In this idea book, we have collected the most common problems that occur with doors and also provided you with the appropriate remedies.",
            "Do you want to repair your doors at home yourself and quickly get rid of annoying squeaking or jamming noises yourself? Then you should read our tips and tricks for apartment doors! We give you important information about your doors so that you can open and close your doors without stress. Regardless of whether the door has a frame or not, repairing a door is not that difficult. We will also show you how to adjust room doors and how to adjust awarpeddoor.",
            "By the way: Here you can see15 original ideas for a shoe cabinet.",
            "Every time you go through a door, you have to lift it so that it doesn't drag across the floor. Not only is that extremely annoying, but it also ruins the floor. There are several ways to solve the problem.",
            "The easiest way to repair the door is to take some space at the top of the frame. Then the door is removed and the hinges are placed under a ring. This lifts the door. If that doesn't work, the hinges have to be screwed in further. Important: If you screw the top one in further, the lock side of the door will rise, while the bottom one will sink a little. If that doesn't work either, the door will have to be shortened! But please don't just cut off the bottom edge with a jigsaw, use a circular saw instead. Otherwise, it will be crooked and uneven and you'll have the same problem again. If you're renting, it's a good idea to discuss this with your landlord beforehand.",
            "When doors close or open as if by magic, they are usually installed crookedly. If you're lucky, only the door leaf is crooked in the frame; if you're unlucky, the entire frame is crookedly installed.",
            "The simplest, but still laborious, option is to lift the door off the hinges and turn the hinges on the door leaf. This regulates the distance between the hinges and the leaf, which straightens the door. You should always put the door back in place after a few turns to test it.",
            "If you prefer to start with simpler means, you can try putting adhesive tape around the hinges and then putting the door back in. Sometimes small adjustments can work wonders. If you're already screwing, you can also try adjusting the hinges. Simply screw the upper or lower hinge in or out further and, if necessary, sand down the frame behind the hinge a little to get more room.",
            "There is no need to worry about creaking and squeaking doors. The easiest way to solve this door problem is to solve it yourself. Because if it squeaks, all you have to do is oil it!",
            "There are two ways to oil a door that makes spooky noises. Old doors often have oil holes in the hinges. They are there for exactly this purpose. Put oil in and you're done. Modern interior doors no longer have the holes. But you only need to take them off their hinges to grease the hinges.",
            "But always make sure you use the right lubricant. Commercially available multi-purpose oils from hardware stores don't always do the job. They contain a lot of liquid petrol and only a small amount of lubricant. It's best to use bicycle oils, as they don't dry out so easily. Sewing machine oil is also good.",
            "And even if home remedies like shaving foam, hairspray or butter initially sound like quick and easy solutions, it's better to avoid them. They do work, but they're only short-lived.",
            "Laying a new floor, incorrect installation or the natural settling of the house can turn a door into an almost insurmountable obstacle. Often, however, a door only jams after a new door leaf has been installed in the existing frame. If moisture is added to this, a lot of the door warps.",
            "If, however, the frame shrinks more in cold and dry conditions or grows more in warm and humid conditions than the door leaf, the door will jam. In the long term, in this case, you can only replace the door leaf or the door frame, ideally with a new or good, used door system.",
            "The easiest way to seal a draughty door is to put a textile, tube-shaped stopper in front of the door. This must cover the entire gap and be extremely well attached to the edge of the door. Otherwise, these things are more of a hindrance in everyday use because they can easily get jammed.",
            "A better way to stop annoying drafts is to use brush seals under the door leaf. They have the great advantage that the flexible bristles also compensate for unevenness in the floor. However, you should first check whether there are washers in the hinges that lift the door. If you can remove these without the door dragging on the floor, the problem almost solves itself.",
            "Making small repairs to your doors is a piece of cake. All you need is a screwdriver and the right parts. You can get new door leaves for around 50 euros. DIN standards have regulated the shapes and sizes of doors since 1985. So if the door is no older than 30 years, you can easily replace the door leaf without changing the frame.",
            "To give your door a new handle, all you need is a so-called handle set (strange word—but it simply means everything that goes with the two handles) from the hardware store, a pencil, a screwdriver, a cordless drill and a wood drill. To be able to use the old drill holes in the door leaf, you need to use at least a handle model of a similar size. It's best to take the old handle set with you to the hardware store when you buy a new one. The many individual parts are daunting at first, but they're not bad at all and can be installed in no time at all.",
            "You simply replace the hinge by unscrewing it from the frame—that's quite logical. You need an Allen key for this. It's also easy to continue: you then put the new hinge back into the frame and when fastening it, make sure that the hinge is about three to five millimetres away from the frame."

As always, it is about both beautifying this area and ensuring that functional and safety aspects are not neglected. Whichdecorative and furnishingaccessories you choose depends essentially on your taste, but also on the individual conditions in your hallway area. For example, if the hallway is relatively small, you should always place greater emphasis on using light sources to make the room appear a little larger. With large staircases, on the other hand, you have even more options at your disposal. Let yourself be inspired.",

It is very important to make sure that the size of the stairs is right! Stairwells or hallways that are too small can quickly appear overloaded when printed wallpaper is used. However, if you manage to integrate the entire staircase into the living space with the help of the wallpaper, you have done everything right. This type of decoration helps you to ideally blur the boundaries between the hallway and the living area and offers you a homely, modern ambience. Due to the large selection of wallpapers available to you, the choice is often difficult.",

It is important, however, that the colours you choose match the general style of the apartment or house. Pastel colours mixed with classic white are particularly trendy here. Most of the tones can be combined excellently with one another and thus create a harmonious image. An attractive colour mix is therefore no longer just popular in children's rooms. As long as the size of the stairs, the incidence of light and the surroundings are suitable, there are no limits to your passion for colour.

Especially if there are children in the household, they represent a source of danger that should not be underestimated. Regardless of whether it is made of glass or rope: transparency has arrived in the hallway and staircase area. Anyone who wants to beautify their hallway will find an attractive alternative to the standard model here.",

Instead, opt for small lights that can be attached to each step, or every second or third step if you like, and will show you the way up safely. Depending on the material of the stairs, it can be useful to use slightly dimmer light to create a warm, cosy look. Read here how you can make perfect use of the space under the stairs!",

You can use these not only as room decoration but also as a room divider. Find out what other tips there are for setting the perfect scene in your hallway here!",

How bold you are in this context, or how bright the colour nuances should ultimately be, is of course up to you. Simple and natural brown tones in particular are becoming increasingly popular, especially in connection with rustic or rural furnishings. The warm earth colours have the positive side effect that they usually blend in well with the rest of the furnishings and thus quickly create a harmonious image. In connection with an otherwise completely white hallway and otherwise modern furnishings, you can be a little bolder. Striking colour mixes are already standard for many people.

            "This photo proves that wood in a complete look is anything but stuffy and old-fashioned. If you choose a light type of wood and hold back on the design language and furnishings, you will create a cosy, natural and wonderfully relaxed ambience with a Scandinavian flair that exudes modern style and invites you to linger.",
            "Wooden ceilings are particularly effective in high rooms that have been opened up to the gable and have large windows. In converted lofts, stables, barns and farmhouses, the ceiling beams provide much of the rustic charm.",
            "A particularly popular interpretation at the moment is white-painted wooden ceilings, which are particularly suitable for low rooms as they visually add depth and size and optimally reflectnatural light.",
            "For a long time, there was a stubborn belief that wood in the bathroom was not a good idea. Puppy cake! Especially in the bathroom, the natural material provides warmth and cosiness—both on the ceiling and on the floor. However, you should choose the right type of wood, avoid standing moisture and leave the laying to aprofessional.",
            "A wooden ceiling can spice up anyliving roomand add a special touch to any furnishing style. If you want to make the wooden beams the focus, choose simple furniture, reduce colours and avoid unnecessary frills.",
            "Wooden ceilings are also ideal for covered terraces, as this example impressively proves. The great thing about the natural material is that depending on whether you lay it vertically, diagonally or horizontally, you can play with vanishing points, create structure and bring exciting perspectives into play.",
            "Here we see that fans of puristic, stylish interiors with wooden ceilings can also get their money's worth. Here, the architect chose not to use rustic beams and instead highlighted the unusual silhouette of the attic apartment with white-painted wooden cladding. It couldn't be more modern.",
            "Wood plays the main role in log cabins and that is precisely why rustic houses are becoming increasingly popular in this country. Solid beams provide a cosy, homely touch and a very special charm.",
            "Finally, we will summarize all the advantages that a wooden ceiling brings with it: It scores with an excellent ecological balance, creates a healthy living climate, can be designed in a variety of ways, is easy to install and also has a positive effect on room acoustics. Convinced?"

            "The assumption is that you can quickly turn off the light in the evening and you will be protected from the annoying mosquitoes. Unfortunately, anyone who believes in this will quickly find themselves struggling with annoying stitches. There is a whole range of tips that help against mosquitoes and their unpleasant bites. Closing the window is more helpful than turning off the light. In addition, mosquito nets and the power of plants are excellent ways to combat the little pests. But which tips against mosquitoes are among the myths and which ones actually repel mosquitoes and keep them away for as long as possible? Thanks to ourexperts,we clarify!",
            "Every summer we have the same problem with mosquitoes. Who doesn't know it: you sit comfortably on the terrace and get stung? If the pests don't strike outside, you usually fall victim to mosquitoes in the bedroom. Even if you supposedly did “everything right”. After all, the typical tips and tricks on how to keep mosquitoes away are well-known, right? Today we'll get to the bottom of the most common advice: Do mosquitoes like light? How long do mosquitoes live? Mosquito in the room, what to do? Can you catch mosquitoes? It's best to read our exciting article right away and defy the mosquitoes this year. You can outsmart them with simple tricks.",
            "Since we're going to be talking a lot about curtains, here's a hint for an idea book with lots of inspiration aboutcurtains.",
            "An old misconception goes that mosquitoes are magically attracted to light. All you have to do in the evening is turn off the light and be safe from mosquito bites. Unfortunately, this is not correct. The reason why mosquitoes tend to come into the apartment in the evening is because they are active at night. During the day, mosquitoes hide where it is nice, cool and humid. In the evening, when the sun no longer shines from the sky, they come out. When the window is wide open, they are magically attracted not by the light, but by the smell of people. Mosquitoes can sense the carbon dioxide that people breathe out and are almost “clouded” by it. If the window is open, they are attracted by it and find their victim with “sensory certainty”. The person who has sweet blood is not more attractive to mosquitoes, as is often assumed. A person who has a higher body temperature and has sweated more is more attractive to mosquitoes and is more likely to be bitten by them.",
            "It's too hot to close the windows in the evening? Then you can close the curtains and open the windows. The curtains then act like a protective wall against the mosquitoes. This is also a pleasant option if you want to use the cool evening air to ventilate. However, the distance between the curtain and the window should not be too large so as not to leave any gaps and not allow mosquitoes to get in. In addition, the curtains should not be coarse-meshed. The closer the texture of the curtain is to that of a mosquito net, the less chance mosquitoes have of getting through gaps in the fabric. An alternative is mosquito screens that can be attached to the windows. They can be easily attached with adhesive and prevent mosquitoes from coming in through the window. They are preferably attached to windows that can be opened but are otherwise of little use.",
            "Mosquito nets, especially around the bed, immerse the bedroom in the ambience of “A Thousand and One Nights”. The wind moves the net and makes it rustle quietly while you can lie down in bed undisturbed. To ensure that mosquito nets not only look beautiful but also serve their purpose, you should pay attention to a few things. The tighter the mesh of the mosquito nets, the more effective they are. Mosquito nets that stretch for decoration alone and have meshes that are too large allow mosquitoes to get through, even if they are more comfortable to sleep on because they allow more air to pass through. Mosquito nets should also be checked regularly for holes. The thin material tears too quickly and is then no longer functional. The mosquito net must be secured around the bed so that it cannot be touched at night. Otherwise, mosquitoes can bite through at points of contact with the net. The net must also be pinned under the mattress or the bed so that there are no openings for mosquitoes to get through.",
            "It's no secret that essential oils protect against mosquitoes. Many manufacturers of mosquito repellents, which do not use chemicals, use this fact to their advantage. While conventional mosquito repellents and their components often fall into disrepute, the essential oils of plants help against mosquitoes without causing any harm as long as you are not allergic to the substances. However, essential oils do not belong in children's rooms because children can also react allergically to them. The most effective plants against mosquitoes include lemon eucalyptus, rosemary, lemongrass, citronella, cloves, cinnamon, but also peppermint and fragrant geranium.",
            "If that doesn't help, sprays against bacteria to disinfect rooms and surfaces are a good choice.",
            "As already described, turning off the lights does not help against mosquitoes. Even dimming the lights doesn't stop mosquitoes from being attracted to the smell of humans. The opposite is the case. Since mosquitoes are active at night, light that is similar to daylight confuses them. So if you want to stay in the apartment with the window open and the lights on, you should light the room as brightly as possible. The more the light resembles daylight, the less likely you are to be bitten by mosquitoes. In thekitchen,for example, general lighting is often ideal for scaring away mosquitoes.",
            "Tip: To protect yourself from mosquitoes even after turning off the light, you should check the room for mosquitoes again before going to bed. Once the lights are out, it's easy to track them down. They soon attract attention with their typical humming noise. You don't have to search the room. You can simply stand in the room and wait for the mosquitoes to find you.",
            "The temperature in the room can be reduced with a fan, be it a permanently installed ceiling fan, a small table fan, or an air conditioning system. The little pests become extremely lazy, avoid the cooler temperatures and, with a little luck, don't even come into the room. A fan has another advantage: it creates wind and mosquitoes don't like to fly against it. However, it must also be set strong enough for this to happen."

            "In this idea book, we will look at 10 ideas for placing the television in a modern living room. Although the shape of televisions and the way we watch them have changed a lot since the arrival of this device into our lives, in many homes we see that the placement of “the TV” in the living room has barely changed. Television, nowadays, is increasingly used to watch movies or television series,streaming, and often connected to other devices.",
            "How does this translate to our living room? Well let's look at some ideas:",
            "The presence of new devices, such as smartphones, tablets and other digital tools, has changed the relationship we have with all of them. In addition to functionality, the aesthetics of these devices have also changed enormously, now being much less bulky, lighter and much more decorative. Nowadays, therefore, it is possible to place a free-standing, suspended TV, as we see in the image. In this way, you will be able to concentrate all your electronic devices in one place, thanks to the living rooms with hanging television.",
            "Precisely because of the lightness that television sets currently have, we can also choose to place them hanging on the wall. In this project, they adopt that solution, creating a modern composition for theliving room.The TV is understood here as another decorative element, combined with a series of shelves and modules, with a minimalist design. Subtle notes of colour provide freshness in a white-dominated configuration.",
            "In this interesting project, we opt for the modern idea of inserting the television in the middle of the living room, through a free-standing element, which it appropriates. We could almost talk about a wall dedicated to the TV, in which the giant screen is located in the centre, becoming the true focal point of the living room. This solution is ideal for dividing rooms when we have a generously sized room.",
            "In this project, the television is placed in a very discreet way. So that the TV goes unnoticed, theexpertshave chosen to paint a strip of the wall behind the television black, in continuity with the side wall. Thus, the black television screen merges with the wall, also black. The final trick is to take advantage of the strong contrast with the rest of the white wall, enriching it with the presence of paintings, posters and framed photos.",
            "In this project, we found a modern and functional solution to insert television into the living room: playing with modular shelves to create the necessary space and achieve a composition full of harmony. This idea is very simple, but also very effective. Alternating modules, arranging them along the entire wall, up to the ceiling, is a solution that never goes out of style and is available to everyone.",
            "A large-screen television has enough prominence to try to prevent it from competing with many decorative elements on the wall it occupies. Today's televisions become the central element of the living room wall. Therefore, choosing a low cabinet on two levels, like the one in the image, is a perfect resource for placing the television and not overloading the decoration of the living room.",
            "The custom design of a wooden wall, with shelves and doors that house objects and books that we want to have in the living room, is another perfect solution for placing the television. To do this, we must be clear about the TV that we are going to place to design the furniture with the exact space that is needed, the niche in which the television is inserted. In this way, we will be guaranteed to achieve a balanced composition.",
            "A niche in the wall covered in natural wood is another of the ideas we found for placing a television screen in a modern living room. In this way, there is a definitive commitment to give prominence to the TV area, playing with the material contrast between the wood in the background, the white paint on the outside of the wall and the television screen itself. Thus, the technological element seems to find its natural space.",
            "In this project we found another idea to place the television in the living room: giving up any other furniture element. The choice here is to place the television directly on the floor, with absolute simplicity. The television is placed on the edge of the rug and centred in front of a modern, low sofa, also in black like the TV itself. The intended careless image of the living room is functional.",
            "A living room piece of furniture, known as a console, fits perfectly into any modern living room and is very functional. In this case, a deep white console is chosen, with blind doors, where a lamp and some other decorative objects are placed. To free up the entire surface, the television is placed hanging directly on the living room wall, centred with the console. Of course, in these cases, it is essential to hide all the wiring…Voila!",
            "Nowadays, we have a multitude of stimuli and entertainment that sometimes prevent us from communicating with those closest to us: family, friends, co-workers… Therefore, sometimes it is necessary to disconnect and leave all technology aside for a few hours. This is what has been done in this room: it has been conceived as a space for conversation, where the complement is the TV cabinet and the device in question, and not the other way around. It is very necessary to create rooms in this way to encourage communication between us. Test it!",
            "Following the idea of the previous example, of trying to ensure that the television does not take away all the prominence of the space and the conversation, a TV cabinet is created where it can be covered when not needed and kept hidden. Especially if you have other elements that you want to stand out more, such as living rooms with fireplaces, this is an ideal option for you. You can find this type of furniture made or custom-made especially for your living room and your television. Don't hesitate to see the options on the market because it is a fantastic idea for your living room.",

            "If you want to start the year more positively and avoid everything that could attract bad luck, take a look at this book of ideas. We've put together 8 things that are bad luck at home and that you need to change now, if you have that in your life.",
            "According to superstitions, breaking a mirror is bad luck. Maybe the bad luck of having it broken and having to spend more money on buying a new one.",
            "If the mirror is broken, you should throw it away to avoid attracting bad luck. The same goes for glasses, don't keep them, because you could cut yourself when drinking from them.",
            "Fun fact: The superstition of 7 years of bad luck, when a mirror is broken, dates back to ancient Greece!",
            "We should not keep old objects and clothes, because these can impede change and make progress difficult. Take a few hours off the weekend to do a general cleaning of your closets and donate or throw away what you no longer want and use. You will see that you will feel a breath of fresh air in your home.",
            "",
            "Storing a tattered broom will not clean thespaceproperly and everything will remain in the same state. According to superstitions, keeping an old broom can lead to money problems. So, don't start the year off badly, change your broom, it costs so little money to risk it.",

            "The superstition of stairs is quite famous and dates back 5,000 years to ancient Egypt. According to this culture, a staircase to a wall forms a triangle, and the Egyptians considered this shape sacred (pyramids). The triangles represent the trinity of the Seuses and to pass through a triangle was to desecrate them.",
            "This belief gained strength over time, and “centuries later, the followers of Jesus Christ usurped the superstition, interpreting it in light of Christ's death”, explained Panati. “As a ladder rested against the crucifix, it became a symbol of evil, death and betrayal. Walking under a ladder brought misfortune.”",

            "On the other hand, in the Middle Ages, in other parts of Europe, there were other people with a contrary belief. They considered that the black cats were the witches' relatives or the witches themselves in disguise, and the Devil was looking at them!",
            "And this is how history influences times and mentalities.",
            "The frog-shaped symbols have several interpretations and meanings. In the past, the frog was associated with magic and witchcraft. So get them out of your house!",

            "Horseshoes over the door, dream catchers in the bedroom, bread and salt for moving in—all these things are supposed to bring us happiness at home and positively influence our well-being within our own four walls. On the other hand, there are also unlucky charms and objects that—at least according toFeng Shuirules—should not be kept in the house. We'll show you what these are in this article.",
            "Do you want to bring good energy into your house or apartment? Then you should follow a few rules according to Feng Shui. We would like to give you a few tips, and you can then receive comprehensive advice from a Feng Shui expert of your choice.",
            "Happiness is a cactus? Is a mirror good in thebedroom?What are typical bringers of bad luck and what brings bad luck? Today we are giving you a little insight into the world ofinterior designwith Feng Shui. It's best to take a look around right away and find out, among other things, whether Feng Shui recommends mirrors in the bedroom or not.",
            "",
            "According to Feng Shui, it's not just broken mirrors that bring bad luck. Even completely intact mirror surfaces can supposedly harm our happiness and well-being if they are hung in the wrong place. Because they reflect used energy, we don't get restful sleep if we place a mirror in the bedroom, for example. This should also be avoided in front of the entrance door, otherwise the Chi will not feel welcome in the house and will immediately be sent out again.",
            "Black front doors can look very stylish and elegant, but they are still viewed very sceptically in Feng Shui teachings. It says that black doors attract bad luck. The only exception: If the front door faces north, this undesirable effect is eliminated. Alternatives for anyone who wants to avoid black doors: dark grey and anthracite look just as elegant.",
            "Cacti and succulents are currently very popular in interior design—but not among Feng Shui experts. For them, prickly plants radiate negative energy, cause tension and aggressiveness and should therefore not be used in the house if possible. However, they look good on the balcony or in the garden, where they can protect us from evil spirits.",
            "According to Feng Shui, old calendars or those that do not show the current date are also bad luck. Why? Quite simply: a calendar like this keeps us stuck in the past and therefore negatively impacts our lives.",
            "Admittedly, rocking chairs can certainly give you goosebumps in certain horror movie scenes, but do they bring bad luck if you have them at home? According to Feng Shui teachings, they attract dark, magical forces and evil spirits. However, you can easily prevent this undesirable effect by never leaving the chair empty, but by using decorative cushions or other objects to make it difficult for evil spirits to take a seat."

            "There are things that you cannot do without in a small house or apartment, especially if it is a house with two floors. The staircase is such a vital element that you cannot remove it, no matter how much you might want to.",
            "In this idea book, we have put together 15 types of stairs that take up little space and are as functional as they are visually appealing. Also, take a look at18 excellent designs for interior stairs in small houses.",
            "This first example not only installs astaircasein a small space but also shows how this small space can be used for several things at once: a vertical garden and a beautiful bookshelf. The staircase itself has a simple but contemporary design and has been finished in white, so it contrasts beautifully with the green garden in the background.",
            "Spiral staircases are the perfect stairs for the second floor when space is limited—like in this case. They have a design that brings movement and never goes out of style. They are also available in many designs and different materials and can therefore be easily adapted to your style and taste.",
            "Stairs that take up little space do not have to rise to the upper floor in one piece. Because there is no railing, this staircase creates an impression of airiness in the lower section and makes the room appear as a unit—a great solution if there is little space in the stairwell. The second section, on the other hand, was provided with a black stair railing and thus contributes to safety in the house. This is especially recommended if there are children in the house or apartment.",
            "These stairs leave you speechless! It is constructed with steps that hang in the air and offer an exciting, industrial design.",
            "This natural wood staircase has adapted perfectly to the space available to it and follows the twists and turns of the room with elegant curves. To preserve the room in its entirety, the stair railing was attached to the outermost wall and coloured to match the wooden steps. If you want such a completely individual staircase, you can seek advice from aninterior designer.",
            "Sometimes not only stairs for the second floor are necessary when space is limited, but also stairs that lead to the attic or a storage room. In such a case, a foldable staircase is an ingenious solution. It saves a lot of space and you can simply fold it out when you need it, which is usually not the case every day anyway.",
            "You don't always need large, wide steps that take up a lot of space. If you use a narrow staircase with steps that are only half a metre wide, you can get a functional staircase in a small space and can save a lot of space.",
            "This staircase is probably the simplest in the entire idea book. If you are looking for an alternative that allows you to get to the second floor but are still looking for a discreet staircase, this classic staircase with simple lines and shapes is the right choice.",
            "This incredibly small staircase is perfect for homes that have an attic or false ceiling. It takes up hardly any space and yet fits into any room with its industrial design.",
            "The stairs can also be designed as part of the hallway, as in this example. Every little corner was exploited here. For example, a small table with a lamp was placed under the stairs, which has a decorative effect and contributes to the lighting design in the room.",
            "No doubt – this staircase is one of the absolute favourites on the list. With its mix of black steel and light wood, it offers a fantastic design and at the same time fulfils an incredible number of functions. It is a staircase, bookshelf, desk, table, cupboard with drawers and storage space all in one. Who would have thought that you could do so much more with a staircase than just climb up and down?",
            "This staircase looks like it is connected to the wall. It adapts perfectly to every corner and every turn of the wall. The spots in the wall ensure optimal visibility and contribute to safety if there is no railing.",
            "There never seems to be enough space in the house for children to play. This staircase has therefore turned into a great place for the children. If you ask the little ones, this staircase with a built-in shop is guaranteed to be their absolute favourite.",
            "The space created under this staircase also opens up many possibilities. A wooden cupboard was installed here, which on the one hand has a decorative effect, but on the other hand, can also solve many storage space problems in a small apartment.",
            "",
            "This staircase is hidden behind a false wall—an original and fun idea to integrate a staircase into the room. This staircase is also perfect for rooms with high ceilings.",
            "Now you've gotten to know our great 15 tips for stairs in small houses and you're sure to have a favourite that would look great in your house or multi-story apartment. An interior designer can help you decide and plan your small staircase so that it ultimately looks beautiful. No matter whether you choose a room staircase, a steep staircase or round stairs, each has its charm. Using a spiral staircase inside can also be a space-saving solution.",
            "One point that particularly impressed us was using the small staircase as storage space. For this reason, we will finally show you an example of how you can store numerous things such as shoes, clothing, bed linen, towels or much more conveniently and easily accessible under a staircase.

            "You can choose from dozens of different types of materials for your countertops and kitchen cabinets. Typically products made from various mixtures of materials such as stone, sand and marble are used for countertops, while products made from wood are used for cabinets.",

Although it has many colour options, it is always a mixed colour structure, not a solid colour product. It is very convenient for long-term and intensive use, but it may be necessary to polish it every year because the occurrence of small cracks in long-term use is likely.",
            "Although marble has many advantages, it is a material that can create stains when in contact with acidic materials. For this reason, careful treatment is necessary.",

            "Acrylic countertops are made from raw material products such as stone, sand and glass, bonded with acrylic. It is very popular because it is an artificial material, produced by machines, and can be easily moulded. The surface is smooth and resistant to scratches, as it is non-porous, which makes this a hygienic and very resistant product. It is often used in the healthcare sector and busybathrooms.",

            "This is also a material resistant to heat, scratches and abrasion, colourless and highly resistant to breakage. Due to its non-porous structure, it is also hygienic. The natural appearance is, however, less appealing than Corian, but it is more economical than natural stones, such as granite and marble.",
            "In this example, the colour and model used in this design perfected the kitchen. A smooth white countertop like this one is perfect for completing a kitchen decorated in a Scandinavian, modern and minimalist style.",
            "Quartz countertops are also included in the composite class, but they are not very economical, as they are composed of quartz stone. There are several brands, including Silestone, the name for which the material itself is known.",
            "The colour range is less varied than that of other composite materials. It is usually sold in a solid colour, but can also be ordered with colour combinations and variations.",
            "It is durable and resistant to scratches and impacts but can be negatively affected by highly acidic materials and chemicals, just like natural stone countertops. Therefore, it requires careful and demanding use but is easy to maintain and clean.",
            "Before deciding on this material, you should evaluate your habits and behaviors, and request the opinion of an interior architect. Every day some innovations and features can be added to every material at your disposal, and learning about the latest innovations will help you make a better choice.",
            "Kitchen counters built with solid wood can be the best choice for elegance and naturalness. The passion for decorating with wood, a result of our admiration for nature and our sincere trust in this ancient material, also manifests itself on our kitchen counters.",
            "The use of solid wood in the kitchen countertop is the most striking feature of the rural style. These benches have the advantage of being robust, practical and natural, but their biggest advantage is that any design will benefit from their elegant appearance.",
            "The solid material stands out for its timeless, textured and natural image. Even when it already has a worn and faded image, it still looks elegant and special!",
            "Solid wood countertops are durable, robust, affordable, clean, natural, environmentally friendly and easy to maintain.",
            "Firstly, it is important to emphasize that laminated counters should not be confused with other laminated materials, such as laminated wood. Laminated wood is a material made up of a few layers of thin wood, used in the production of parquet, but not in the production of countertops!",
            "Countertops produced from real wood are known as solid wood countertops, while laminate material is a material that consists of a layer of vinyl lacquer, followed by a layer of paper or plastic material, which gives the appearance, and an HDF layer.",
            "These benches have smooth surfaces and come in a huge range of colours and patterns. They can last a long time when used carefully, but they are not as durable as stone or composite materials. It's almost impossible to repair them when you leave a hot pan on them.",
            "Stainless steel counters, a must-have for modern and industrial styles, blend well with almost all cabinet and floor materials.",
            "These countertops have advantages over stone and wooden ones and have been especially popular in modern kitchen decorations in recent years. If we want to highlight, this material has only one disadvantage:—the damage is difficult to repair. But otherwise, you can use a stainless steel countertop for decades without any problems.",
            "Together with stainless steel sinks, these countertops form a successful team, which can adapt to practically any modern or industrial design.",
            "As you can see, you have countless options for kitchen sinks. It will depend on your taste but without forgetting all the care that each material requires, taking into account the intended use."

            "Peach: it's not a colour that we use in homes too often, but perhaps it's one we should turn to more. What exactly is peach? It's a mix of pink and orange, often a light and soft tone. As it's a warmer tone, it can brighten a room. Adding peach can bring a summer glow to your home and it looks great with most other colours. In fact, this tone peach is associated with warmth, youth, and friendship. If you like softer warm colours, then peach is a perfect choice as an accent colour.",
            "",
            "So if you're ready to start decorating your home with peach accents, then let's take a look at some inspiration so we can steer you in the right direction.",
            "Painting something in your home peach — whether it's ahallway, an accent wall, a chair, or a cabinet — immediately adds warmth to a room in a very unexpected way. We love the way this two-toned peach wall looks, especially with the yellow doorway in the background. As you can see, peach goes wonderfully with all-white walls and simple furniture as well. Paired with plenty of plants, the peach wall really shines here.",
            "Peach is a great colour to use in the bedroom as well. Try using peach bedding or pillows to add vibrance or warmth to the room. Here, the peach is subtle and toned down — using duller peach tones can be a good way to avoid bright colours if you prefer a calm space. Against white, grey, and cream, the peachy tones look rich and regal in this room. Additionally, adding a peach accent wall or headboard can help to tie the warmer tones in a room together.",
            "This peach accent wall looks superb in this dining room. Framing a piece of art, the peach tone helps to make it pop and goes well with the mural on the ceiling as well. Notice that the room incorporates a lot of white again, which is the best way to keep a room feeling fresh and bright. However, the addition of navy-coloured dining chairs adds depth and looks rich against the summery shades of the rest of the room.",
            "Yes, you can use peach in the kitchen. Try utilising peach by choosing warm-toned plates to display or adding peach-coloured kitchen accessories like oven mitts. Peach looks especially great with blues or greens, so do add plants when you use peach in a room. Don't be afraid to add other bright colours like light to medium blues or teals, or greys. Also ensure there's enough natural light to keep a peach wall from looking dull.",
            "Putting peach accents in the room doesn't mean adding stark colour to the room — sometimes, the subtlest of additions can make the biggest impact. Here, the lamp shades are a peachy brown tone, which looks fabulous against the grey-green walls. The simplicity of this shade makes it super versatile, so try experimenting with pops of peach around your home. Aninterior designercould help you to figure out the best arrangement and where accent colours will work best. It truly is an art!",
            "Who would have thought — peach looks great as an exterior colour as well! While this may not be for everyone, peach is a lovely warm tone to use as exterior paint. Another idea to add peach to a yard is to add Adirondack chairs or a peach table — it could be a great look for the approaching summer.",
            "",
            "Speaking of summer, add urban jungle vibes to your home withthese ideas.",
            "",
            "Let's look at more subtle peach decor inspiration.",
            "Adding peach throw pillows is a smart way to bring warmth to your living room.",
            "Peach chairs? Yes, it's actually a fantastic idea. These chairs add a warm glow to the room and a more retro vibe that we love.",
            "Again, peach paint adds dimension to a room. And while you don't have to paint the whole room for a sunset glow, we certainly love the way this room feels like a holiday.",
            "For a girl's room, peach is a nice colour to swap out your average pink with — it's softer and the orange tones neutralize the colour more, so you can pair this chair with anything. Try a peachy pouf or lounge chair."

But if the word 'floral' reminds you of stuffy, older homes, then you're not alone. Floral patterns have been recycled through new trends in almost every decade. But that doesn't mean that floral patterns have to fit the retro 70's or Victorian-era style.",

            "Choosing the right floral pattern for your home comes down to colour and size, but also remember to complement your patterns with your solids in each room. You'll want to pick floral patterns that also draw on one of the accent colours of the room so they don't look out of place. Consider sizing, too — a larger floral print may be too bold for you, while others might prefer the funky, retro look of a bold floral. Smaller floral patterns are quieter and may be easier to match with your home.",

            "Oak beams are the strongest and heartiest of all wooden beams, and they are also the most popular type of wood used throughout the world. Then there are plywood beams – these beams are generally used as vertical and horizontal stiffeners. Plywood beams are lightweight and are used to create stronger structures by nailing them to flanges. There are also veneer beams. This type of beam is created by adhering multiple layers of thin wood together.",
            "Cleaning wood beams, unfortunately, requires a lot of effort and precautionary measures. Before using any hardcore cleaning method, it is best to dust and vacuum the beams. You can clean your beams by soda blasting them or chemical free blasting them. These processes remove and strip the paint, varnish, and any smoke damage (from cigarettes, cooking, fireplaces, etc.) and both processes are not harmful to the wood. And because of the nature of this type of cleaning, you can be very precise with which areas you clean without having to worry about damaging any nearby materials.",
            "If you want to go for a more natural way of cleaning your wooden beams, you can create a vinegar and water solution by mixing two parts water and one part vinegar. Pour the mixture into a spray bottle, spray it on a clean rag, and use the rag to wipe the surface of the beam. Vinegar is a natural cleaner and disinfectant that removes residue without damaging the wood.",
            "Some parts of your home are more likely to attract dirt, grime and grease than other areas. For instance, in an open kitchen, the fumes, smoke and grease will build up quickly, requiring a more frequent schedule for cleaning. The same will be true of wood beams on theterracepergola. While you might be tempted to use chemicals to simplify the process of cleaning the wood bean ceiling in the kitchen, bear in mind that it can damage the material in the long term since you will need to use it more often. So, it’s best to stick to natural products.",
            "One way to restore your wooden beams is to remove the old finish on them. A lot of the time, it is the finish that looks the most tattered, and as it should, being the protective outer layer of the wood. Then, choose an oil or natural beeswax to stain the beams. Oils and wax penetrate deep into the grain of the wood and replenish it. This also helps in slowing down the aging process, as the oil and wax form a hardening layer on top of the wood that will reinforce it and protect it from future damage.",
            "A beeswax polish can be made by shredding a bit of beeswax into a jar and covering it with pure turpentine. Leave the jar to sit overnight and then shake well in the morning. The turpentine will dissolve the wax and subsequently create a good polish. If there are any holes in the wooden beams, make a thinner wax so that it can be brushed into the cracks in the wood. If the timber has worm holes, make the wax into a thinner consistency by adding more turpentine so that the mixture can be brushed deep into the wood, as it will help consolidate the damaged area. Then, apply the wax to the beam with a soft cloth. It is important never to use a thick coat of wax, as it will remain soft on the wood and make it look dull.",
            "Not all wood beam ceilings and rafters are easily accessible. So, for those that are challenging to restore on your own, hiring aprofessionalis a better idea. But, make sure you get it done at least once a year as neglect can cause the condition of the wood to deteriorate quickly.",
            "As with any maintenance ritual, there are certain products that should be used and certain products that should definitely not be used. One thing you never want to use in cleaning a wooden beam is water. As we have said earlier, one of the causes of wood aging is constant exposure to rain, snow, or humidity. Cleaning with water will only increase your chances of damaging your wood.",
            "Another product you want to stay away from is linseed oil. Linseed oil used on wood tends to remain quite sticky and therefore attracts dust and dirt which discolours the wood over time. Harmful cleaning chemicals should also be avoided. They tend to strip the wood of its integrity and strength, and definitely stay away from insect repellants. Some people believe that insect repellants will keep infestations at bay, but they just end up eating up the wood instead.",
            "The frequency at which you clean depends on a few factors – how old your wood is, how susceptible the beams are to moisture or infestation, and how much traffic you get in your home. A good rule of thumb to go by, though, is a twice a year cleaning.",
            "If you have very old wooden beams on theroofor ceiling, it can be a slippery slope when it comes to how often you should clean. You might think, the older, the more you need to clean, but that isn't necessarily true. The older your beams are, the weaker they tend to be, so sand blasting your beams often may lead to even greater weakening. If your beams are in a high moisture area, or you have experienced infestation before, you may need to clean them or apply wood varnish more often. And if you have a large family or just tend to entertain a lot, you will find yourself needing to dust and vacuum your beams more frequently (which is a great preventative measure against aging), but you don't necessarily have to go through the entire deep-cleaning process.",

Constructed on a steep hill outcropping that gives a bird's eye view of surrounding countryside, the main feature of the site is the beautiful tree canopy which creates a jungle like setting and keeps the environment serene.  In order to preserve the ecological balance of the region the builder's team designed the structure on the slope with minimal tree felling in such a manner that it perches lightly on the ground.",
            "The abode rests peacefully underneath the canopy of large trees and remains cool even during harsh summers due to the carefully designed galleries, windows and apertures that allow unhindered flow of breeze across the house.  Brief was to design a comfortable home for a mid-sized family and the build up area assigned was 10000 square feet. Architects M J Kanny were asked to focus on a structure that blends together interiors and exteriors in a seamless fashion. Access to the house was from a road located close to the slope edge and entire structure was designed abutting hillside. So when guests arrive at the driveway leading to car porch the house seems almost invisible. Let us explore this interesting house designed with a mix of traditional and modern touches to keep the carbon footprint as small as possible.",

The house has a large area dedicated to the kitchen so that it has enough space for everyone to cook or work in the kitchen. The kitchen island merges seamlessly into the cozy eat out for the family. There is another dining area spreading into a living space that can be used for formal meals and parties.

            "Today we're going to dispel the prejudice that men don't care about the appearance of their homes. The image of a messy bachelor pad with a randomly thrown-together collection of furniture, dirty laundry lying around and stacks of empty pizza boxes and beer bottles is a thing of the past. Modern men love cool designs and chic styles—even in their own four walls. That's why we've brought you a few impressiveinterior designideas for men, which women also love.",
            "Less is moreis without a doubt the motto of the masculine interior design style. You won't find any frills or superfluous frills here. Instead, the focus is on clear shapes, straight lines and reducing things to the essentials. Details such as curtains, carpets, cushions, flowers, etc. are often dispensed with and a lot of emphases is placed on style and design.",
            "The straightforward design of the masculine interior design style is particularly popular with muted earth tones and natural materials. Cool shades of grey, elegant, dark wood and black leather look sporty, elegant and high-quality. Raw materials such as concrete or steel also appear very masculine, but shiny chrome is also one of the top components of the male-interpreted interior design style. In terms of colour, modern men prefer to stick to subtle tones such as black, grey and brown in all shades.",
            "As important as style and elegance are when furnishing with a masculine touch, thefurnituremust not only look good but also reliably fulfill its purpose, and be practical and functional. Sofas, beds and armchairs should look stylish, but they must also be comfortable and convenient; wall units or shelves must be eye-catching with their design, but automatically create a tidy ambience and safely and reliably accommodate plasma TVs, stereo systems, etc. Furniture can also impress with several talents at once. Multifunctionality is key.",
            "One of the most important aspects of the masculine living style is individuality. Despite all the straight lines and functionality, the furnishings should still be tailored to the preferences and personality of the occupant and should also express these. Whether a man collects model cars, is a passionate musician, football fan, film freak or passionate amateur photographer—the collector's items, devotional objects or the results of the hobby are displayed at home with pride, but by no means strikingly, and thus bring a very personal touch to the apartment in a stylish way.",
            "To ensure that the masculine-styleinteriordoesn't look cold and boring, a certain balance should be ensured. This means: Please don't do without decorations completely. Instead, add chic accents with a few high-quality accessories such as vases, plants, cushions and pictures and thus create a cosy and inviting atmosphere."

            "In the summer, we tend to neglect thelightingin our house. But now that the dark season is upon us, lamps for indoors and outdoors are more important than ever—and also part of ourinterior design. Regardless of whether we want to make our four walls warm and cosy, have a cool design or are very classic: the right lighting sets the interior in the right light. In this idea book, we present you with 16 ideas that we can use to make the walls of our house shine, both inside and out. Ready?",
            "The lighting on the exterior facade of a house can be very simple—or, as in our example, prominent and unusual. As part of the planning, the experts attached a strip to the facade in the terrace area, on which some spots shine downwards. These create a beautiful triangular shape, which makes the wooden deck a very special place.",
            "How beautiful is this exposed brickwork in the spaciouskitchenanddining area?To ensure that it does not lose its appeal even at darker times of the day, minimalist cuboids were used as spotlights that emit light upwards and downwards.",
            "The experts have taken a different approach with this wall, which is also a room divider. The wall looks a little like it is outside—including the gravel edge. Six spotlights are set into the gravel bed, which illuminate the wall from below. We think this is a beautiful play of light!",
            "Rough stone walls are a beautiful design element for rooms as well as outdoor areas. Walls that are in shades of grey or anthracite are sometimes difficult to depict as they look very dark. Spots like the ones in our picture help to illuminate the wall and create beautiful effects through the rough structure. The light creates attractive contrasts, especially with the narrow green strip.",
            "We wanted to show you this beautiful terrace because the lighting on the natural stone wall connects the two parts of the building with the inner patio so wonderfully. Small spotlights set into the ground and shining upwards onto the wall immersing the inner courtyard in an almost mysterious atmosphere. A white-painted concrete block in front of the wall invites you to sit and relax.",
            "In the past, lights were only intended to illuminate rooms. Today, however, lamps can do much more than that. In our example, we see a rare integration of lamps. Because they let light out on four sides, an interesting cross-shaped look is created on the natural stone wall on the terrace of this house.",
            "These lights are also more of a design object than a lamp. However, in this case, it is not the wall that is illuminated, but the ceiling of this lounge. What already looks great in the bright lighting must create a spectacular backdrop in an otherwise dark environment.",
            "In this single-family home, our experts have installed a mix of different eye-catching and more subtle lamps. While spherical hanging lamps can be found throughout the ceiling area, the design of the wooden wall is more reserved. Wide but narrow spots made of stainless steel provide small, warm lighting for the wall.",
            "We go outside together again to an outdoor area that is intended as a parking space for a car. Here, small spots are set into the ground on the wall, which cast warm light—almost like small flames—onto the terracotta-coloured wall. Light points in the wooden pergola provide additional light from above.",
            "Sometimes there is no other option in rooms than to work with outlets on the wall. One of the reasons for this is the lack of power cables in the ceiling. If this is the case, you don't have to tear open the entire ceiling to integrate the right lighting. There are numerous spotlights available on the market that cast powerful light into the room.",
            "Isn't that a magical play of light? Small window niches in the wall of the staircase let daylight into the building at certain points, while still providing plenty of privacy. Round wall lamps bring light onto the stairs so that no one falls. Our tip: especially on stairs, make sure to install spotlights that are as flat as possible in the wall so that no one gets caught on the lamp cover.",
            "Now let's look at a completely different wall area that is no less interesting: We are in a kitchen that, due to the given dimensions, is partly in a somewhat dark corner. Thekitchen plannerssolved this challenge by installing spotlights under the upper cabinets in the corner area that cast a triangular cone of light downwards. This means that the entire corner is illuminated so that work can be carried out here without any problems even at dark times of the day.",
            "Lamps don't always have to emit light in specific spots. With LED strips, you can also design areas continuously. This is also the case in our example, where the upper edge of the wood-clad wall was covered. This is a great effect, especially in the dark, which supports the linear design of this living area.",
            "We're sticking with unusual lighting designs. Here, square spots with warm light have been completely sunk into the ground. The lights are not intended to illuminate the room, but rather to accentuate the gravel bed in the living area. Successful, in our opinion.",
            "This staircase area at the entrance of the modern single-family home also proves that indirect light creates a great atmosphere. You would think that the subtle lights outside are not enough in the dark. This example proves the opposite. Precisely because the stairs have been underlined with light, they are so well lit at the edges that no misstep can happen.",
            "At the end of our collection of ideas, we will go back to a classic single-family home, which shows through the various lighting systems how important it is to plan the lighting points when planning a new building or renovation. If this is forgotten during the planning stage, it is almost impossible to make up for it once the building is finished."

Let's start with our first idea—a spacious living room such as this really deserves everything posh and ornamental. To start with the concept, furnish the ideal gathering space with a luxurious grand sofa of your choice.",
            "It can be anything from a tuxedo sofa to a modular sofa. With the help of your interior designers, mount the best looking chandeliers and choose to ornament the room with complementing ceiling lights. You can always have a low-built decked cupboard aligned towards the wall to complete the look.",
            "To fuse in more aroma of grandeur, go for pastel-hued artificial flowers and ceramic showpieces. Remember, do not overcrowd the space with everything and just go for accessories that help in bringing out a lively contemporary look.",
            "Wooden furniture and materialization is not only unique, but also helps in bringing out the essence of modern decor. You might wonder how wooden accessories would do the rounds in your living room!",
            "Well, take a look at this amazing concept—a vivacious living room with adequate space for everything modern. Go for a loveseat-style sofa attired with contrasting covers and plush cushions.",
            "Now all you have to do is run your creativity in choosing the best wooden furniture to ornament the empty corners of your living room. Choose a low-built wooden table to sit peacefully on the angled center of the living room.",
            "With the help of your designers, shelf an asymmetrical alignment of wooden shelves running throughout the wall area. To finish the looks, go for minimal lighting and pastel-hued blinds.",

            "A royal living room such as this is a desire of those who love colors and lighting! While everything is in place—your sofa, table, and TV unit, try to focus on something more vibrant. Yes, we are talking about shading the accessories with rich colors.",
            "Go for a luxurious combination of blue, grey, and white. Attire your living room with colorful blinds, sofas, and walls by carefully picking a perfect combo of these three vibrant colors. To complete the look, mount a grand chandelier on the center.",
            "You can also complement the empty corner with a royal lampshade! This concept not only looks modern, but is also blessed with everything savvy and gorgeous!",
            "We all know the wonderful magic of color combinations and when it comes to home décor, it is obvious to run our creative minds with colors. Tint your living room with rich brown and yellow-hued ornamentation.",
            "Go for an ivory brown-hued sofa complemented by plush yellow cushions. A golden-yellow glazed velvet fur rug crowns the look of the wood-marble tiled floor. Sequence your blinds with an adjacent finish of chocolate brown and caramel yellow. To finish the look, shelve some antique collections and ceiling lights.",
            "Now this concept is not only vibrant, but also fosters a sense of positive energy from all angles.",
            "This is our personal favorite! This living room is the best when it comes to reviving the space with cute concepts and modish looks. With the help of yourinterior designers, attire the gathering space with neatly aligned wooden and bamboo sofa complemented by plush white cushions.",
            "Towards the angled center, place a mesh-balled iron wrought glass case table as shown in the illustration. This table is the showstopper in this concept! To fuse the looks with more elegance, have a wooden block-patterned ceiling running through the center above.",
            "A vintage-style ceiling fan just about the seating completes the look of this modern and cute-looking living room concept!",
            "A decent sofa adorned with plush cushions marvelously aligns the corner of this concept. A low-built ceramic-style marble table beautifully sits on that velvet-mesh rug you picked recently! Moving on to the TV unit, well ask your designers to have a minimal slab-style shelving unit just below where your big size LED TV is mounted.",
            "Now coming to the gorgeous hint of this concept, well, make some art out of waste! You heard it right—reuse the remaining marble slabs after you're done with your kitchen counter and table. With the help of your designers, get these slabs cut into cute hexagon-shaped structures and have them cemented on the wall.",
            "As shown in the illustration here, this concept would be the liveliest idea to flaunt the lavish and modern looks of your living room.",
            "Coming to end of our living room journey, we have saved the colorful one for the last! Fuse your living room accessories with rich and bright colors. Start with your sofa cover—attire them with bubbling colors of blue, red, white, and orange.",

            "The idea behind this is to fuse natural light with the light decor in the kitchen. A pearl white finish on your cupboard gives a slim and satin shine while illuminating with the natural daylight.",
            "This wonderful idea is a great concept for amodern kitchenwith a touch of professionalism!",

            "With rising movie ticket prices and problem of traffic snarls everywhere, going for a movie with the entire family and having a great time outdoor has become expensive for most families. So here is a solution if you are are looking to create a similar environment with a small investment to get a fully immersive movie experience right in your own home. We are here to help you with the pertinent question of where to begin? Yes there are many variables to consider like screen size, seating arrangements, speaker systems, lighting which may make your wallet lighter by several dollars.Our workers have created several home theater layouts across the world and we have put together some of the best ones to give you inputs about creating the entire design process.",
            "While getting the home theater designed by a professional is the best alternative as it requires  intimate knowledge of electronics, acoustics and design, an enthusiastic DIYer risk taker with adequate knowledge of basics can also make a reasonably decent home theater. Here are some home theater ideas that will help you to understand that beside investing in appropriate audio visual equipment one also has to select appropriate seating options for the room.  If you have a tight budget then a few essential details can suffice to make a home theater ormedia roomand we recommend that you familiarize yourself with acoustics and lighting before beginning the experiment.",
            "Selecting the right room and making a budget are the foundation stones of designing a home theater as only then one can plan layout, equipment, decor and other details. The ideal size of a home theater room should be 20 feet by 13 feet and relatively away from the rest of the house. ideally theater rooms should be built in basement of family room that are spacious and large enough to seat family members comfortably and does not disturb neighbors.",
            "Choices of home theater interior décor ideas are limitless so start considering if you want a casual entertainment area where the entire family can relax over a movie or you want a real theater like experience with surround sound,special lightingand other arrangements.  Some people believe that décor in this room should be consistent with other parts of the house. But people with large budgets can indulge in creating thematic ambiance for their home theaters and work with interior  decorators to create artistic images featuring favorite movies, colors, movie stars or patterns.",
            "The most important part of any home theater set-up is a display screen and though the temptation of setting up a large screen to enhance viewing pleasure is strong there are limitations. An immersive experience is fine but it should not be so large that it forces viewers to swing the head every-time to catch the action. Use an expert’s help to find right combination of size and angle for the display. Finding the best viewing height is also important and ideally the center of the display screen should be at eye level for the idea home theater design..",
            "",
            "In this media room idea the residents have stuck to a casual layout where the living room is the main entertainment area. Instead of having a separate theater room they large screen television on  the wall is used for streaming all forms of videos like movies, television programs, games and internet streaming content. Sound system is spread across the room with boom boxes placed in strategic locations to enjoy an immersive experience.",
            "You wouldn't want neighbors to complain abut sound pollution would you and call cops when you are in the midst of an interesting scene? Then soundproof the theater area with soundproof drywall or treat the walls with materials that dampen the sound. While the former is quite expensive the latter can be done with thick vinyl on the windowless media room and also affixing a solid-core door. Here is a theater room layout with comfortable seating arrangement located at sufficient space away from the screen",
            "A classic home theater includes a video projector along with a large screen and great sound system to create the right ambiance of a real-time theater. Covering all areas where light can come in is critical as screens can get washed out by stray light. Along with energy efficient projector lamps you would also need to have space to setting up boxes for streaming content and maybe a video player too.",
            "Ensure that the seating arrangement in your home theater is suited for various age groups that are likely to use the region for entertainment. The chairs should be comfortable enough for aged people to get up and sit down and also for squirmy little ones that may keep walking in and out of the home theater.",

            "We always demand perfectionism in our kitchens. Because kitchens today are not just for cooking. They also reflect our love for an individual style. However, especially insmall kitchens,we always struggle with enough storage space. Because everything else often looks far too chaotic.",
            "We seized this opportunity and collected ideas from our professionalkitchen plannerson how we can best store our food and kitchen accessories, even in small kitchens.",
            "This deep drawer offers space for all kinds of accessories—it's all a question of proper organization. In our first example, on the left side, we find a place for knives and wooden spoons of all kinds, and on the right side, there are the most commonly used spices at a glance.",
            "Openshelvesand cupboard modules can quickly become too much of a good thing, especially in small kitchens. They make a room seem even smaller than it is. Our tip: It's better to store some of the dishes and kitchen accessories behind uniform cupboards and drawers.",
            "In this kitchen, the spices are hidden behind a narrow wall unit. In our case, it is arranged vertically and can be pulled out completely. We think this is a solution that is particularly gentle on the back.",
            "Furniture and kitchen appliances don't always have to have the same design. But they should somehow form a unit. The kitchen we see here combines the light kitchen fronts with the stainless steel appliances almost perfectly.",
            "Students or young professionals don't always have the budget to afford large planned kitchens. Then you have to stay within the chosen budget. That also works, as we can see in this small kitchen. A modular kitchen cabinet has been combined with an open shelf that even houses a microwave. Kitchen accessories such as ladles or spoons are simply hung on a rod.",
            "Cooking pots and pans are kitchen appliances that can be difficult to store—their shape alone ensures this. In this drawer, an order was created by dividing the drawer with a few narrow dividers. This way, the pots don't slide around in the wrong place. Clever: Also in the same drawer is a swivel module with storage space for small sieves or other flat accessories.",
            "Such pivoting modules make a lot of sense, especially inkitchensthat extend over corners. Otherwise, the pots in the furthest corner of the cupboard are hard to reach. Chaos is then unavoidable.",
            "This kitchen uses a pull-out vertical module, which is now available in all possible sizes. In our case, it is a very small and narrow shelf that can hold the most important spices. A practical design that also looks good.",
            "Kitchens that have to be built into a corner almost always have to face the challenge of how to make the most of the space in the entire corner area. Here, several narrow pull-out drawers have been combined. They offer maximum flexibility given the limited space.",
            "The interior of this kitchen cabinet has been structured with just as much attention to detail as the exterior. Drawers of different heights offer space for kitchen appliances, dishes and cutlery. Beautiful wooden drawers divide the drawers so that nothing can slide into one another.",
            "Vertical stainless steel modules not only look stylish. They are also particularly robust, easy to clean and require little maintenance. This means that the one-time investment is worthwhile over many years.",
            "Often we have a kitchen built in our house and realise far too late that we have forgotten the rubbish bins. These days, it's not just a bin that's left lying around, but usually an organic waste bin and plastic waste in addition to the general waste. Our kitchen planners have planned the rubbish bins directly into the kitchen and installed them in such a way that they disappear behind a cupboard.",
            "What a look! The kitchen planners in the next example followed an industrial design and functional lines. It's not just the white tiles and the sink that speak this language. The open shelves that stretch across the entire width of the kitchen are also a testament to this.",
            "Admittedly, this wonderful wooden ladder doesn't offer much storage space. But it looks incredibly chic and houses some beautiful kitchen appliances that are far too good to be hidden behind cupboards.",
            "Here we come to a design that almost looks like a cupboard within a cupboard. Behind a white closed kitchen front, there is an interior cupboard with many compartments. Here you can store baskets, spices, flour and sugar, biscuits or tea. The cupboard is so tidy that the open kitchen cupboard itself seems like a design element.",
            "With this minimalist kitchen, we might think that it has very little storage space. But that's not the case. The beautiful white kitchen begins behind the kitchen counter and offers swivel modules in the corner that can accommodate lots of kitchen accessories.",
            "Sometimes our style dictates that we want to show off our collected dishes. This can be done with an open shelf like this, but it is divided up in such a way that all the pieces look nice. The shelf and work surface are somehow reminiscent of grandma's times—but interpreted in a contemporary look.",
            "This drawer has been designed really cleverly. Stainless steel modules divide the drawers into different areas for open foods such as salt or sugar and spices in tightly sealed containers."

            "If you don't have much space or no natural light in thebathroom—or if you live in a shared apartment and therefore have to get out of the bathroom quickly—a dressing table in thebedroomis a great idea. Of course, a dressing table in the bedroom also makes sense if you like to do your make-up and hair while sitting down. In this article, we would like to give you a few important tips about your dressing table so that you can enjoy this piece of furniture for a long time. There is room for a small dressing table anywhere. However, it is important that you adapt the style of your new make-up area to that of your furnishings and thus create a coherent, harmonious overall picture. Please take a look at a few ideas from ourinterior designers.We are excited to see which solution you would like to implement.",
            "When it comes to a dressing table, paying attention to thelightingconditions is imperative. Daylight is particularly popular because it makes the makeup look as natural as possible. You can store your makeup utensils in one of the small cabinets, conveniently and easily accessible but still neatly stored away.",
            "In this example, a place in front of the window was also chosen to create the best possible lighting conditions. If you place a simple table next to your closet, you can store your make-up and other make-up utensils there and take them out when needed.",
            "If the light falls from the side onto the dressing table in your bedroom, you will also get very good lighting conditions. Put a chair next to the table and your dressing table is ready. If you wish, you can attach a wall mirror or set up a small makeup mirror—whatever you want.",
            "You can see a particularly romantic example of a dressing table in this example. The light falls pleasantly through the thin curtain and thus provides a very beautiful and natural light. You can also put a small lamp on the table as an additional light source.",
            "You can store all your cosmetics neatly in this dresser. If you want, you can also put your makeup right on the dresser. To do this, simply move the nearby armchair closer, find your makeup and your mirror in the dresser and off you go!",
            "An illuminated mirror is also a great idea for setting up a dressing table. This way you have more flexibility in how you arrange the table—you don't necessarily have to put it near the window. You can store everything in the drawers of the dressing table and a plant next to the table creates more ambience.",
            "You're never wrong with this fold-out table! You can store lots of cosmetics and at the same time have a large table surface available. Put a lamp on the table and attach a mirror to the wall if necessary. Your dressing table is ready.",
            "Whether it's a desk or a dressing table, this table is suitable for a variety of purposes. It's quick to assemble, easy to combine and gives any bedroom a modern touch."

            "Here atHomify, we always present you with great renovation and modernization projects that show how old-fashioned, unfashionable single-family homes can be transformed into stylish, contemporary and attractive homes. Today we have brought you the amazing transformation of a staid housing estate house, which our experts fromArchitektur Liniegave a completely new look and feel. The interior photos of the project were taken by the photographerChristoph Tempes.",
            "We begin with a look at the facade of the house before the renovation and conversion work. It is a classic housing estatehousewith a gable roof, like those that were built all over Germany in the post-war period. Over the past years and decades, however, the demands on single-family homes have changed fundamentally, so that this home did not meet the expectations of its new owners in aesthetic, energy or practical terms. So ourexpertshad a lot of work to do.",
            "Hardly recognizable, is it? Here you can see the street façade after thearchitectsfromArchitecture Linietook on the matter. The old-fashioned housing estate house was transformed into a modern flat-roofed building in a contemporary shape and colour scheme, which was only equipped with small window openings on this side of the house to protect the privacy of the residents in the densely built-up housing estate.",
            "Of course, we don't want to withhold thebeforeview of the back of the building from you either. Here, the single-family house is surprisingly modern and opens up to the garden on the ground floor with a large window front. This concept should be retained, but the appearance and of course the energy balance of the house should be significantly modernized.",
            "The after photo clearly shows that the large glass front on the ground floor was retained, as was the balcony on the upper floor. The gable roof was replaced by a more contemporary flat roof and the windows on the first floor were significantly enlarged. In addition, light grey accents were added to the white facade and the terrace was made more spacious and more homely.",
            "Unfortunately, we don't have any before photos of the interior of the house, but a lot has happened here too during the renovation and modernization work. The small-scale floor plan with narrow rooms typical of classic housing estates has been broken up and the entire living space has been made more spacious, spacious, bright and airy, as can be seen in the new entrance area. Large doorways with practical sliding doors lead into the living area, and a modern, railing-free staircase leads to the upper floor of the house. The interior has been colour-coordinated with the outer facade. Lots of white and light, subtle tones dominate the overall picture.",
            "The ground floor is now practically one large room, in which the kitchen, dining and living areas merge seamlessly into one another and benefit from the large windows at the back of the house. From the open kitchen with white handleless fronts, you go through the dining area into the living room, which invites you to linger with its cosy fireplace corner.",
            "For you:Transforming a 30-year-old apartment into a modern space.",
            "Even in the large bathroom, nothing reminds you of the past other than an old housing estate. The room is characterized by plenty of space, modern furnishings and high-quality materials. Natural daylight comes in through the high, narrow windows, while at the same time preserving the privacy of the residents. Bright white on the walls and the large mirror open up the bathroom even more and give it even more visual depth.",

            "There is hardly anyone these days who doesn't have at least one piece offurnitureorfurnishing accessoryfrom IKEA at home. No wonder, it's because the products from the Swedish furniture store are practical, inexpensive and functional. The furniture in particular impresses with sophisticated storage solutions, space-saving concepts and cool design. One of the most popular IKEA models is the KALLAX shelving system, which is available in various sizes, dimensions and colours and can be used both as a shelf and as a room divider or, with the doors closed, as a storage miracle. Today we'll show you six great furnishing ideas with KALLAX.",
            "TV furniture can be quite expensive. If you want to save money, simply go for KALLAX as a cost-effective alternative that is practical and looks great too. The compartments underneath can either be left open and used as shelves or fitted with doors or drawers. KALLAX is also available with castors for those who like to remain flexible.",
            "Using KALLAX as a bookcase is a classic that also works well as a room divider and can then be filled with books from both sides. But record collectors also get their money's worth with the IKEA shelving system and can store their vinyl treasures safely, practically and stylishly. Another tip for theliving room:Equipped withdoorsand drawers, KALLAX is a casual and inexpensive alternative to the traditional wall unit.",
            "KALLAX also looks great in the dressing room. In every conceivable size and design, it stores shoes, accessories, bags, folded clothing and jewellery—behind closed doors or in drawers, as you prefer.",
            "In the home office, KALLAX is a reliable partner and practical accomplice that can easily handle all kinds of files. Numerous different inserts also allow us to visually ensure order and seriousness.",
            "In the hallway, the IKEA KALLAX shelving system can either function as a stylish shoe rack with storage or, in the single-row version, as a clever bench that helps you put on your shoes. Things like gloves, hats, scarves and umbrellas can be hidden in matching baskets or inserts.",
            "Here we see a place where IKEA's KALLAX shelves are particularly popular. Thanks to its many clever uses and design options, the shelving system is a hit in children's rooms. Here it serves—with or without inserts, cupboard doors and drawers—not only as a bookshelf and storage space for toys but also as a wardrobe alternative, room divider, bench or even a doll's house. The best thing about it: KALLAX practically grows with the kids and is just as useful in the baby's room as it is later in the teenager's room.",
            "A super creative idea for all cat fans who want to give their furry friends a cosy den but don't want to buy new furniture. This felt insert makes it possible. It fits perfectly into every KALLAX from IKEA and invites cats to hide, snooze and laze around.",
            "Another creative hack for all KALLAX shelves from IKEA: The compartments of your favourite shelf can be transformed into space-saving and stylish record storage in no time.",
            "Knitting fans will also get their money's worth with this ingenious KALLAX insert, which ensures that you never lose track of things.",
            "One of the unbeatable advantages of the IKEA Kallax shelving system is that you can easily and effortlessly transform the shelf into a cupboard when needed—thanks to matching door and drawer inserts.",
            "If you find a plain shelf too boring, you can turn your KALLAX from IKEA into a stylish highboard in no time at all, and you won't be able to tell where it comes from. Simply add feet, a matching top, replace the drawer knobs and add inserts as you wish—and your customized, wow piece of furniture is ready.",
            "Our last example also shows how elegant the IKEA KALLAX shelving system can be: In this dressing room, it looks like a much more expensive piece of furniture and becomes a style guarantee par excellence."

            "A walk-in closet is every woman's dream. But many men can also get used to the idea of having extra room for clothes, shoes and accessories. Many people know the dressing rooms from Hollywood films or luxury apartments. But it is not that impossible to set up a walk-in closet in your home. You don't necessarily need an empty, separate room that has access to your bedroom. With a little space, a few simple tricks and a little craftsmanship, your bulky closet will soon be a thing of the past. Today we would like to explain to you how you can integrate a walk-in closet into yourbedroom.You can of course also hire ahomify professionalto do this work for you. If you want, you can even have walls installed that turn the dressing room into a separate room. Today we will show you how you can make the luxurious dream come true.",
            "The first step in setting up your walk-in closet is to determine the size. Look around your bedroom and consider where the walk-in closet should or can be placed. Keep in mind that your old closet can either be integrated into the project or used for something else. Otherfurnituresuch as a bed, dresser and armchair can also be rearranged to make room for the dressing room. One option would be to place the walk-in closet behind your bed. The bed can then simply be placed against the new wall or the back wall of the closet. A bedside table on the left and right, a nice picture above the bed and the new bedroom is ready!",
            "You can read this article that talks about20 wardrobe ideas for a small bedroom.",
            "The simplest solution to integrate a walk-in closet into your bedroom is to align two large closets. As shown in the example image, one closet is used as a room divider. The closet should go up to the ceiling, as it can be secured there for safety. The whole thing can of course also take place in a corner by aligning two closet walls at a 90-degree angle to a corner. Just look at how your bedroom is laid out and what options are available. Make sure that you plan enough space to be able to move around and change in your walk-in closet. The back wall of the closet, which serves as a room divider, must of course be properly covered. Light wood materials are perfect because they can be painted and even wallpapered. Of course, you can't consider the new walk-in closet aroom, but you can still create a small area that is reserved just for your clothes.",
            "Aprofessionalcan of course get a lot more out of your bedroom. New walls can be put in to create a proper room. However, your bedroom should be a little bigger to ensure there is enough space for the dressing room. The room can also be fitted with a space-saving sliding door. This means the entire closet disappears from your bedroom and you have space for nicer furniture and home accessories.",
            "To design the dressing room exactly as you want it, you have to choose the right colours and materials. Since the closet area is open on one side, it is advisable to adapt the design to the rest of your bedroom. If you have white furniture, you should also choose white materials; if you have wooden furniture, you should choose wood to achieve a harmonious overall look. In general, however, light materials are more suitable, as they brighten up the small, probably windowless room a bit.",
            "Before you rush out to buy a wardrobe, you should take a look at what kind of clothes you have. The point of a walk-in closet is to organize clothes, accessories and shoes as clearly as possible. If you have a lot of shirts and blouses, you should make sure you have enough space to hang them up. Long dresses and winter coats, however, need a deeper space to be able to hang them up without creasing. There are special devices for belts, ties and other accessories in which they can be stored in a space-saving and clear manner. A laundry basket should also be planned in your walk-in closet so that you can immediately distinguish between clean and dirty when you change. The following is also important with shoes: high heels are of course always nice to look at—sneakers, on the other hand, could cause a noticeable smell in your closet instead of a chic look. If you want to store all kinds of shoes here, you should get a few nice boxes or crates in which to store them.",
            "Light is particularly important in a dressing room. After all, you want to be able to see the colours of your clothes correctly. In dim light, it can easily happen that a black sock and a dark blue sock are chosen. This can lead to embarrassing moments at a later meeting. A bright ceiling lamp provides a decent basic light, while spotlights can be aimed directly at the clothing. For those who like things a little more luxurious, special shelflightingis an option. This is mounted directly on the underside of the shelves and illuminates everything that is in the area below. If you want to implement the DIY version of the walk-in closet, you can also work with clamps or floor lamps.",
            "One accessory that should not be missing in any walk-in closet is a mirror. This way you can check your outfits directly without having to go to the bathroom or bedroom. There are no limits to your imagination when it comes to further design. If you have enough space, you can of course choose a comfortable armchair for your best friend to sit on while you try on the clothes for your next date. Pretty baskets for accessories, a bowl for jewellery or decorative boxes are also a good choice for beautifying your new dressing room. In the example picture, you can see a spacious dressing room, the design of which is not only luxurious but also cosy. The fluffy carpet makes it easier to pick out the right clothes in the morning with cold feet. You can also see the perfect example of how beautiful baskets and boxes can enhance the room. If you have a small bedroom that cannot under any circumstances accommodate a walk-in closet, you don't have to be sad."

            "The first step is the most difficult because it starts with a battle with our inner weaker self. But today there are no excuses. So: Get your butt off the couch, turn off the TV and let's go. We set our stopwatch and give ourselves ten minutes to prepare everything and equip ourselves with the necessary tools, devices and utensils. Important accomplices in the next three hours are vacuum cleaners, mops, cloths and rags, sponges, brushes and various cleaning products, a bucket with lukewarm water and a feather duster.",
            "Before we look at theroomsindividually, we first have to do some general tidying up. Over the next 40 minutes, we go through every room and remove any items that are not in the desired location. Clothes that fly around go either in the laundry or back in the closet, used dishes are put in the dishwasher, what is no longer needed ends up in the trash, books go back on the shelf, etc. In this way, we have created an initial sense of order. We can clean without being disturbed and immediately feel much more motivated.",
            "The next half hour belongs to the living room. Here we first dust and vacuum. The best way to do this is to first remove the coarsest crumbs with a handheld vacuum cleaner and then use the feather duster to do the finishing touches. Don't forget often neglected corners, shelves and table surfaces and wipe them thoroughly with a damp cloth. The floor is then thoroughly vacuumed and mopped. Important: Choose the right cleaner for the floor covering.",
            "The kitchen often presents a particular challenge when tidying up and cleaning. Thanks to step one, we have already put everything in its place, removed used dishes and disposed of leftover food and other rubbish. Now it's time to clean. To do this, first vacuum the surfaces and the floor and then wipe the surfaces with a cloth and the corresponding cleaner. The stove and sink sometimes need particularly intensive attention with a sponge and polishing cloth so that everything shines and shines in the end. Finally, the floor is quickly mopped—and this room is finished.",
            "After the kitchen comes the second problem child: the bathroom. We start by cleaning mirrors and surfaces with appropriate (glass) cleaners and microfibre cloths. Then we take care of the sink, shower and toilet. Important: For optimal hygiene, use different sponges and cloths and use hot water if possible, which kills the bacteria. Finally, the floor is vacuumed and mopped.",
            "There's usually not much to do in the bedroom once the infamous piles of clothes are removed. While we remove and remake the bed, we ventilate it properly. Then we go over all surfaces with the feather duster and finally turn on the vacuum cleaner.",
            "The remaining 15 minutes belong to the dining room and the hallway. When guests come, it should look particularly beautiful here. It's already tidied up, so it's time to dust the surfaces and then vacuum and mop the floor. Finally, we add a few fresh accents. How about, for example, fresh flowers in a vase, a beautiful scented candle or a room fragrance? All of these things ensure a pleasant living experience and guarantee that guests—and not least ourselves—feel right at home."

            "Neutral colours are currently very popular when it comes to living. From sand to grey and from beige to white, trendsetters in the interior sector have been decorating their homes in a more subtle and reserved way when it comes to colours for a long time. At the top of the popularity scale is currently an exciting mixed tone of grey, brown and beige: taupe. Incidentally, there is no clear definition of when a shade can be called taupe and when not. In general, anything that lies somewhere between grey and brown can probably be called taupe. Sometimes the versatile trend colour even goes a little in the direction of old pink or violet. For this idea book, we took a look at ourinterior designers and decoratorsand brought you various living ideas for the colour taupe. Be inspired!",
            "We begin our concentrated load of inspiration with abathroomin a light taupe tone. In addition to classic white, modern bathrooms are currently dominated by shades of sand and grey—or a successful mix of both, as can be seen in this example. The floor, wall tiles and bathtub panelling blend seamlessly into one another and the neutral taupe creates a beautiful contrast to the white of the rest of the furnishings without losing the harmony.",
            "Would you like to also know more about somemodern colours for a chic and contemporary bathroom?",
            "The colour taupe also looks great in thekitchen,as this example proves. The great thing about this trendy colour is that it is as cool as grey, but the brown component makes it look warmer and more natural. And thanks to its neutral effect, taupe is a perfect combination partner for all other colours or other taupe tones or similarly neutral shades.",
            "Taupe is not only suitable for modern, minimalist interior design ideas with clear, straightforward lines but also comes into its own in the more playful, romantic version. Here we see a lovingly furnishedbedroomin a dreamy country house style, which uses a light taupe tone alongside clean white, making it particularly inviting and magical without appearing too kitschy.",
            "Taupe is also the perfect choice for the floor. If brown is too warm and grey is too cold for you, then this trendy mixed tone is just right for you and can turn any room in your home into an absolute style highlight. Whether it's real wood parquet or laminate, tiles or carpet, whether in the kitchen, living room, bathroom or bedroom—taupe really can be found in every variation and for every taste.",
            "Here is another example of the colour taupe in a modern bathroom, this time in a light colour. Clear lines, modern fittings and high-quality sanitary objects are the perfect partners for the neutral trend colour, which radiates homely warmth and cool elegance at the same time and turns every bathroom into a stylish wellness oasis.",
            "Taupe can be used not only in the kitchen and bathroom or other rooms as a floor or wall colour. Even the smaller details look great in this trendy colour. Home textiles such as pillows, blankets and curtains or smaller decorative objects such as vases, figurines, candles or these pretty fabric hearts look super modern in taupe, yet warm and friendly and are the icing on the cake of any interior.",
            "This bed is truly a dream in Taupe. The eye-catching headboard is complemented by pretty pillows and a bedspread—and you feel like you're in a luxury hotel. The great thing about taupe: There are seemingly endless different shades between brown and grey and they can all be wonderfully combined with other colours.",
            "Taupe is also ideal for windows and their textile design. Whether it's a roller blind, curtain or drape, whether plain or patterned—a little taupe is a must these days. The perfect choice for anyone who is not only looking for reliable privacy and sun protection on the window but also wants to create a modern, timeless and homely interior.",
            "Taupe is currently a particularly popular wall colour. No wonder: A wall in this tone looks much more exciting than boring white, friendlier than cool grey and cooler than beige. Another plus: Taupe goes with all styles, colours, materials and textures and always forms a reliable, stylish backdrop for all interior design ideas. So with taupe on the wall, you can only win.",
            "Here we see a successful example of how well taupe harmonizes with other colours. The great sofa looks wonderful in front of the blue wall. The trendy colour is ideal for sofas, armchairs and other upholstered furniture anyway because it looks cosy and inviting, but at the same time stylish and timeless.",
            "Taupe is particularly popular in the living room—both as a floor or wall colour and in the form of furniture and accessories. This way, you can furnish your living area in a trendy and modern way, but at the same time be sure that the whole thing won't be out of fashion again next season. Taupe will not be a thing of the past anytime soon.",
            "Whether it's a guest toilet or a master bathroom—tiles in taupe are always a good idea if you can't decide between grey and beige. The contrast with white bathroom ceramics is particularly eye-catching without being too prominent. A real advantage of the trend colour: If you choose a light taupe tone, you can use it to design small mini-bathrooms, while a darker shade looks particularly good in large rooms.",
            "Here we see another example of how well taupe goes with stronger colors. The colourful chairs look perfect in front of the neutral brown-grey wall. Regardless of whether you want to set accents with red, yellow, green, blue or pink details—taupe simply goes with everything and allows colourful colour partners to make a big statement.",
            "From the living room to the dining area and from the bedroom to the hallway: with a wallpaper in dark taupe, every room can be impressively changed and given a new look. By the way, light furniture goes particularly well with darker tones on the wall, and dark furniture goes particularly well with light wallpaper.",
            "Not only within our four walls but also outdoors, all signs are pointing towards taupe at the moment. Muted, smoky, grey-brown woods without a red or yellow tint are ideal here, as they naturally match the trendy shade perfectly. From the house facade to the patio flooring and the balcony furniture to the garden fence, you can design your outdoor area entirely in trendy taupe and remain completely natural."

            "That's why we have put together a list of ten ideas for concealing ugly walls, from the expensive to the cheap DIY. All these wall decoration ideas have been executed or conceptualised byinterior design professionals. Let's begin the countdown!",
            "Forwallsthat are not in dire need of professional help, we recommend installing a wall-sized bookshelf. This is actually quite easy nowadays, since the shelf market is totally saturated, making wall-sized shelving fairly cheap and easy to purchase.",
            "A shelf doesn’t necessarily have to be a traditional wood-toned, linear one. You can think out of the box and customise it to boost the wall design. For example, in a kid’s room, an innovative street-themed shelf design can offer an exciting and fun way to display the child’s collection of cars, while making it easier to keep the room looking tidy.",
            "Our favourite way to hide an ugly wall is to create a cool mosaic design. Mosaics are so multifaceted and easy to DIY that an unsightly space can be spiffed up in a matter of a day.

            "A good old-fashioned corkboardfor pinning up your to-do lists and notes or one of these clever ‘everything’ magnet boards is a great way to cover up an ugly water spot or unrepaired hole in a functional way. Just measure, purchase and hang!",
            "Put up a qualitycurtain—not a tacky beaded curtain but a thick, snazzy cloth one that makes the room feel warm and luxurious. For extra dazzle, choose a fabric with a strong metallic thread woven through it, or go all out with sequins.",
            "Wall tattoos are different from murals in that they do not just cover one wall -- they can be placed along edges, and spill onto floors, as pictured here. What a unique alternative for drawing attention away from the fact that a wall is otherwise quite plain!",
            "A fun solution for hiding a plain wall is bolting up several wall lamps that are super cute, or just one or two that emit interesting light patterns. The larger the wall, the bigger the lamp—simple!",
            "Yep, use a funky set of blinds or window shades, paint your own window frame, and hook up the necessary infrastructure to create the fantastic illusion that your ugly wall is, in fact, just another grandwindow. You can even make this a DIY, how to paint a wall mural project to create a realistic and personalised piece of décor.",

            "Less bulky than a full wooden wardrobe is the clothes closet made simply by stringing up a piece of string between two walls, in the same manner as a clothesline. String up the line at a fair distance from the back wall you wish to detract attention from, then, just hang up your trendiest clothes in front and voila! Nobody even notices the wall.",
            "Sometimes, less is more, especially when it comes to a small room. Instead of installing an artwork or wall painting, a wall-to-wall wardrobe ticks boxes, both in terms of being practical and appealing.",
            "Perhaps this sounds strange at first, but a faux-fence in front of your least favourite wall, paired with a few of your favourite wall plants, can do a lot to exoticise any wall. Make sure the faux fence's top 'skyline' is a bit jagged and is of a contrasting colour to your wall, as shown in this picture, in order to get the full effect though.",

            "The simple expansive furniture, carpet with geometric elements and stylish false ceiling give the room a strong character while the unusual shape of the windows has been used to enhance the charm of the area. Clutter free wall fitted with unique lighting system reflects the artistic interest of the people living here in an emphatic manner.",
            "In this living room two focus areas have been created within the architectural design to reduce monotony and have a lively environment. While the glass facade behind the television panel is a strong intense color without stressing the boundaries of the space and small lights on the ceiling and grand chandelier are together responsible for maintaining comfortable atmosphere.",
            "Small living room is not synonymous with cramped spaces as this design will show you. Wall outlined in black stylishly divides the living area from dining region and also add beauty to the image where geometric figures are an important element.  The lighting arrangements in each section of the room add depth to the image while the charming selection of light colors is pleasing to the eye.",
            "Whichever section of the living room you are trying to improve be it floor rugs, window decoration  or furniture arrangement, ensure that you know the exact measurements and size furniture pieces and the place you are going to fit them into. There are several handy guides that one can use but  you have to follow what works best under the circumstances and space and is also aesthetically pleasing to the eye.",
            "White furniture and long hair carpets that feel like soft snow within white walls complete the picture of a pristine Scandinavian living room. The glass table looks just right just like the ambient lighting glinting from the false ceiling and stylish curtains standing like sentinels bythe windows.",
            "Whatever style you choose for the living room decor, such as modern, classic, rural, Scandinavian, or a combination of two-three styles, you need to have combination right for living room style to be truly spectacular. Here classic style furniture has been placed in a modern setting but nothing looks out of place as the lighting and wall decor blend everything seamlessly into a beautiful picture.",
            "When view of horizon outside the living room is as spectacular as this with sky extending like a beautiful vision then every other detail inside simply fades into insignificance. Nothing can compare the natural colors of the sky during sunrise and sunsets so do not waste money making walls where it is not required and  maximize the positive elements of nature in your living room like this.",
            "Using area rugs in the living can be a bit of a challenge if you don't know how to place the right. Instead of buying one just because it looks good may turn out to be a waste of money if it is the wrong size, color or design as it may make the entire room disjointed. Ideally all the furniture should be touching the rug or around it and there should be several inches of open flooring between living room walls and the area rug.",
            "It is very important to choose the right curtains for the living room as they can bring great improvement and charm in the atmosphere. Here we have living room in neutral tones in which curtains play a major role as the windows are large and form a powerful backdrop. So combination of white and dark long curtains have been used which complement the light gray sofas and dark cushions of this room with the rest of the furniture.",
            "This is a modern living room without the usual trappings of electronics which is a quite common in most homes as the owners wanted a meeting area without distractions. The oval shaped sofas are created just right for comfort during long family discussions under the delightful brightness of a charming dome shaped chandelier that adds to the cheerful environment.",

            "This beautiful contemporary style house was designed on a plot of land located in Nilai, Negeri Sembilan byKuala Lumpur based MJ Kanny Architects. The building site was on a slope of land that looks like a funnel from the road below and its actual width is visible only when one drives up to the vast landscape of the property which is surrounded by large durian trees. The house unfolds like a beautiful dream before visitors's eyes as they drive towards the house up the small incline.",
            "As the owners had requested for a single level dwelling with 5 bedrooms and a large kennel to house their two dogs the final structure which included large terraces and pool along with garage and landscaped garden spread across more than 7800 sq ft. excluding the garden. The intention was to create a dwelling that would be a form of experience for guests up the driveway to the front entrance and then towards the vast garden at the rear. The architects therefore designed the entrance like a tunnel that draws the people into the house and directs them towards the interiors, terrace and pool followed by the landscaped garden.",
            "",
            "As the house is built on a slanting slope it was designed to take advantage of the surrounding area and a strong foundation was needed for the large dwelling. One section of the structure was therefore elevated by about 1200mm above the ground that created a void like a traditional Kampung house on slits. This helped to draw in cool air from the ground into living room and bedroom through several open floor slots built into the floor.",
            "The roof is designed to mimic the sloping landscape, the roof opens out above the garden and creates the illusion of a double height room in the living room making the room visually spacious.",
            "",
            "The best feature about this property is that it is surrounded by greenery across the landscape that creates an aura of aloofness and privacy to the actual house. From here we see the entrance region and the garage on the side. On reaching close to the house one can grasp its actual length and vastness as it is spread across the site like a vast rectangle. The different wings of the house on either side are connected through the tunnel that runs across it from front to rear like a corridor and opens into the vast garden.",
            "",
            "",
            "The entryway of the house is symbolized with a large glass shade that looks like a wooden canopy from the road. This is shaped like a tunnel and leads visitors all the way into the house and towards the backyard. It is connected to both wings of the house on either side as one walks in through the entrance foyer into the gallery and beyond. It is built this way to allow free movement of cool air all around the house even during hot summers.",
            "",
            "This stylishlyminimalist living roomgives a sweeping view of the garden, infinity pool and dining area behind it. But beyond the simple layout and design of the living room guests are most likely to be overwhelmed by the vast open spaces that features across the house and is emphasized by the sloping roof and glass facade that opens onto the terrace.",
            "We love how the terrace here gives a mesmerizing view of the entire hillside, landscaped garden and the infinity pool beside it. The open air terrace has a shaded roof made of timber trellis and a glass canopy to provide shade from sun. The wooden decks on the terrace besideinfinity poolare perfect for relaxation after a long swim on warm evenings.",
            "Now who wouldn't love to use this bathroom with a glass roof that almost feels as if one is under the open sky and not inside a bathroom. The archiects have decided to use stone and rough brick in this space to give a total outdoor aura to thisrustic style bathroom. Imagine having a nice warm shower here when torrential rain is pouring outside, wouldn't it feel as if one is bathing with warm water under a waterfall!!",
            "This is the view of the front door from within the tunnel style entryway. It was specially created to give a unique look to the house and create a dramatic style walkway without any windows to increase drama. This narrow pathway helped to emphasize the vastness of the living room and other sections of the house when it opens abruptly and guests are taken aback with the magnificent view of the rear side.",
            "As the section facing the garden is on the North-West side it is not directly exposed to sunlight so to maintain a light and warm feeling the archiects have used sunlight glazed windows on this side with sliding panels. This helps to bring natural light inside and also maintain visual connection of other parts with the lush garden greenery. This house was created with a vision to keep it as environment friendly as possible for which eco-friendly materials like solar roof panels and rain-water harvesting technology was used to meet water needs.",
            "This dining region is just between the living room and kitchen but is subtly separated from both by height and layout. Both the living and dining areas are the heart of this beautiful house but other ancillary sections are connected through concealed geometry to give an air of spaciousness and privacy to residents.",
            "We now come to end of our tour with a night view of the house, the property looks inviting, peaceful and a relaxing retreat for the home owner and friends!",

That's why we've put together 15 beautiful counters of this kind for you today that add value to kitchens.",
            "If space allows, we can add another table to our kitchen island—if we have one. Our first counter, which only consists of a few solid wooden boards, has enough space for a whole family. In an emergency, you can even prepare food on the worktop.",
            "As a rule, a breakfast bar is of course in the kitchen. But there are other options. Perhaps you have a beautiful winter garden or a covered terrace where you could set up such a bar outdoors? Then let's getplanningfor the next outdoor season!",
            "A bar doesn't have to be built in a very complicated way. Sometimes a high-quality wooden board is enough to extend a kitchen island to include a counter. Add a few chairs and you have the perfect place to sit to start the day. Tip: Ask your local specialist whether your kitchen could be easily extended!",
            "If we have a large kitchen in an even larger living space, a bar helps us to limit the available space. The advantage of this separation in the picture: that visually, the kitchen is transformed into a closed room, even if there are no walls.",
            "Sometimes a counter can be not only a place to sit but also a room divider. And that is exactly what was solved perfectly in the mini kitchen. The small black bar creates a visual separation between the living room and the kitchen. Yellow, stylish bar stools are a real highlight in the room.",
            "Of course, the kitchen is one of the rooms that should always be well-lit, either by daylight or artificial light. In the second case, it should be perfectly placed when it comes to the appropriate lighting of a counter. The lighting situation is beautifully solved at this white, elongated bar. In addition, the white fronts and walls of the kitchen contribute to the brightness, although there are hardly any windows available.",
            "There are now countless chairs and counters available in stores—for every taste, in every colour and the desired style. The best thing to do is to browse through specialist magazines, kitchen studios or the Internet.",
            "If space allows, this is a great way to add a counter to your kitchen. This works particularly well in open-plan living spaces.",
            "Bars and counters for kitchens are available in any design, as we want to show with this example. If you don't like the off-the-shelf models on offer, individual fronts can be attached to the standard modules.",
            "You can create a small bar in the kitchen even if the space is small. For example, a worktop can be extended a little to accommodate one or two bar stools. This creates a small dining area that is extremely practical and doesn't get in the way.",
            "Sometimes the shape of the room makes it difficult to imagine a small dining area in the kitchen. This picture is a good example of this. Because the room is not only elongated but also has a small wall that protrudes into the room, there is hardly any space for a table. Luckily, thekitchen plannershad a good idea and installed an extremely narrow worktop on the right-hand wall that opens up towards the end. Everything is also well-lit through the window above.",
            "A small, movable bar like this is great for very small kitchens. You won't be able to eat a four-course meal here, but it's enough for a quick morning coffee.",
            "As we see time and again, wood is one of the most popular materials in kitchens—including kitchen counters. And for good reason: the variety of wood types always creates new looks, no matter what style you are pursuing. And because the material is easy to paint, wood is particularly versatile.",
            "This modern-style bar is set on two levels, giving it an interesting accent. This is reinforced by the two-tone design of the counter with a black base and white table tops. Theoretically, the upper worktop can be used as a work surface, while the lower one can be used in a classic way for eating and drinking.",
            "The last example not only has a practical meaning but also serves the structure of the room. The elongated counter intelligently divides the kitchen and living areas. We think this is a good solution even for the tightest of spaces!"

Over the decades, the needs of today's society have changed—and with them the houses. We attach great importance to living our everyday lives in our houses as openly as possible.",
            "That's why it's almost always necessary to tear down certain walls in old houses to create larger rooms. However, this step requires a certain amount of specialist knowledge. Not every wall can be removed so easily for structural reasons. We have an overview of the details provided by ourarchitects.",
            "Today, our idea book is about the exciting topic of load-bearing and non-load-bearing walls. After all, walls play a crucial role, especially in the context of interior design and layout. To decide which walls can be torn down and which cannot, you should—in addition to looking at the building plans—also ask aninterior architect.A professional knows which is a load-bearing roof beam and which wooden beam supports the wall, etc. How thick is a non-load-bearing wall? Or how can I recognize a load-bearing wallattic? Can I build a load-bearing wall? We answer all of these questions for you!",
            "Once you've finished planning your walls, it's time to decide on the colour scheme for them.Hereyou'll find great inspiration for large and small rooms!",
            "A basic detail for understanding whether we are dealing with a load-bearing or non-load-bearing wall is usually determined by the position of the wall within the house. Thick external walls, for example, are usually load-bearing walls, because the entire structure of the building rests on them, such as the rooms above, ceilings and walls, as well as the roof. It is more difficult with internal walls in the house. If walls are stacked on top of each other over several floors, they could be load-bearing walls. Sometimes knocking on the wall can help to hear what the masonry is like. Our tip: always get an expert on board for an assessment. Because possible later damage to the house can be immense.",
            "In multi-storey buildings, retaining walls can be identified by looking from bottom to top. This is because the walls that are closer to the ground often have very thick walls that have a load-bearing function, and rooms are placed one above the other on each floor to dissipate forces. Other walls in the upper part of the building are sometimes thinner or made of a non-load-bearing material such as wood or MDF boards. These can be removed without any problems. However, electrical or water pipes could run through them. Therefore, a detailed inspection is also mandatory here! The load-bearing walls on the lower floors must remain unchanged so that the building does not become unstable.",
            "We recommend this idea book for you:The Best Interior Design Hacks for Round Walls.",
            "Load-bearing walls can vary in thickness depending on the material used and the type of structure. That's why it's important to have the wall carefully inspected by a professional. Walls made of reinforced concrete, sand-lime brick or concrete are usually load-bearing. So don't just tear them down with a sledgehammer! Partition walls made of plasterboard or bricks are easier. As a rule, you can assume that a wall is load-bearing if the masonry is 17.5 centimetres or thick.",
            "Walls often consist not only of the wall material itself but also come with various frames or supports. These are also part of the overall statics and must remain in place before being inspected by an architect or carpenter. Incidentally, half-timbered houses should be looked at separately when it comes to statics. Houses with wooden frames were built less according to technical standards than based on the extensive experience of local craftsmen. This is why the statics in such a house can be misleading.",
            "In this example, we also see a living space through which large wooden beams and supports run through the visible area, bearing the weight of the rooms above. When inspecting an older house, always keep an eye out for beams like this somewhere.",
            "If a building has not been built correctly, normally non-load-bearing interior or partition walls suddenly behave as load-bearing walls. Therefore, if you suspect this, it is best to consult a specialist before tackling such walls. Also, pay close attention to the statics of wooden beam ceilings. In most cases, load-bearing masonry is perpendicular to the span of the wooden beams.",
            "What have we learned? Never tear down a wall if you are not sure whether it can bear the weight of a building or not. And even if you think you know, you should call in a professional. Because once damage has occurred, it is very difficult to repair."

            "Does yourhousefacade need a new coat of paint? Or do you simply want to give your house a different colour look? A new coat of paint on the facade is like a face mask: sometimes the applied layer brings a little refreshment, but sometimes a complete renovation is just desperately needed. Whendesigninga facade, personal taste is the most important criterion. But not everything that you like is allowed and within the scope of what is possible. Factors to be taken into account include the surroundings, the choice of the right colour system and the size and location of the building. We will show you step by step what you need to pay attention to when choosing a colour so that the new paint lasts as long as possible and your neighbours turn green with envy when they see your facade.",
            "The colour of a house facade not only determines the character of a building but also shapes the neighbourhood and its surroundings. You can't go wrong if you choose white as the base colour. With striking colours such as pink or blue, great caution is advised, as there is a risk that the colourful building will dominate the entire neighbourhood and look completely out of place. Your personal choice of colour should always harmonize with the context, i.e. fit in with the overall concept. On the one hand, this means that the house paint does not stand out too much concerning the neighbouring houses. On the other hand, the colour should also be chosen in harmony with the building parts such as the balcony, garage and roof. These days, you can find out whichfacadecolour suits your house and its surroundings with the help of colour simulators and 3D planners that allow you to try out different colour variants of the house. Many municipalities stipulate what is legally permitted, which is why it is best to get information directly from the responsible office before starting your work.",
            "There are colours such as yellow and orange that convey warmth and security. Then there are colours such as blue or turquoise that radiate coldness. The same applies to the different facade materials available: reddish-orange to earth-brown Corten steel or wooden facades are often associated with naturalness and warmth, while grey aluminium and fibre cement make the facade appear cold. So when choosing colours and materials, always keep in mind what effect the new paint should have. Of course, there are other aspects to consider when choosing colours and materials. If you do not want to achieve your desired colour on the house facade with a new coat of paint or plaster, but with a specific material, then you must find out as much as possible about the respective material properties, including maintenance effort and costs of the corresponding facade cladding. When choosing colours and materials, be sure to get advice from a specialist such as anarchitect.He will be able to tell you which of the many facade systems best suits the condition of your house wall.",
            "With a dark grey facade, you are definitely on trend right now. The advantage of a neutral tone is that it is timeless. You won't get tired of it so quickly.",
            "This premium facade paint in professional quality impresses with many advantages: self-cleaning through the lotus effect, high CO2 and water vapour permeability, protection against algae and fungal infestation, extreme weather resistance, low emissions and solvent-free, lightfastness and a huge selection of colours.",
            "For a colourful facade paint, you need to know that it not only has to look good, but first and foremost it has to protect the building. The quality of facade paints depends largely on the properties of the binding agent they contain. Facade paints with a high binding agent content, such as pure acrylate, are considered to be particularly colourfast and durable. Ready-mixed dispersion silicate paints are also popular because they are easy to use and offer good rain protection. Dispersion paints are among the all-rounders among facade paints. They are moisture-repellent, permeable to water vapour and are also available in many colours (including strong and unusual ones). Silicone resin paints are part of the luxury class of facade paints. They are extremely permeable to water vapour, and water-repellent and provide effective protection against fungal and algal infestation.",
            "It makes a big difference whether you redesign just one wall or the entire facade. After all, paint and materials cost money. A compromise can be to set a nice accent by painting the most exposed side of the house. Keep in mind that the size and shape of the house also influence how the colour looks. For example, it is not advisable to use bright and eye-catching colours for the entire building, as they can be very obtrusive in context. The location of the house also plays a key role in the colour effect, as the colour appears in a different light depending on the sunlight. In addition, constant and intense exposure to light—for example on south-facing walls—causes colourful facade paints to fade over time, similar to rain.",
            "If you are painting the facade yourself, you must prepare the surface accordingly before painting. Make sure that it is clean, dry, without cracks and stable. For a long-lasting, beautiful result, you must carry out a visual inspection, i.e. remove defects such as discolouration, loose paint, old plaster, dirt, algae and moss. The best way to do this is with water and a brush or, even more efficiently, with a high-pressure cleaner. For an even and absorbent surface, you then apply a facade primer. Before doing this, cover all windows, doors and other openings that could get dirty with masking film. Before the main coat, use a facade roller to apply a primer diluted by ten to 15 per cent so that the paint appears richer and adheres better. You can then apply the second and final facade coat undiluted.",
            "The first impression counts. This wisdom also applies to a house. If the building looks run-down from the outside, you don't want to look inside. Impressive living rooms and other rooms often await us here. An attractive exterior, on the other hand, looks inviting. A house facade needs a new coat of paint about every ten years. Of course, the time intervals also depend on how damaged and dirty the house wall surface is. If there is major damage, don't wait too long, because the more time you let pass, the more expensive the entire facade renovation will be for you. Also plan the weather conditions when painting: weather that is too hot, too cold or too wet will damage the paint. The same applies to direct sunlight when painting, as the paint dries too quickly. For optimal colour results, it is best to paint in spring or autumn when the temperature is mild and the sky is clear. Don't forget: always stir the paint well before applying it!",
            "As you have seen, adding colour to the facade of a house is not that easy. You have to put a bit of thought into it.",
            "When you think about the colour choice and style of your facade, you should also include the design of yourgarden.Depending on the style you pursue in yourgarden,the house facade should also be designed accordingly. Do you have lots of blooming flowers, and playful elements, mainly lawns? Ornate, colourful, traditional or modern—there are many possibilities. Once the style has been decided, the question now arises:",
            "Painting the facade – which colour? After all, the house colours are at least as important as the style.",

We tend to think that gardens are exclusively for the outdoors. The truth is that it is ideal, that nature develops outside, but certain species need special conditions for which we create indoor gardens. In this way, we bring vegetation to more closed spaces than usual, we create the right conditions for the planted species and we manage to bring the joy of the outdoors inside our home.",
            "We like to see how home gardens develop, especially if they are colourful. During all times of the year, a garden can look spectacular. And this can only be achieved if you have professionals who know what species to plant, how to locate them, what shapes and volumes to achieve, etc. These professionals are landscape designers, who know perfectly everything that is related to vegetation, outdoor furniture, maintenance and irrigation systems.",
            "To tell the truth, I'm sure someone has asked themselves the question:I don't have a garden, what should I do?Well, very easy: in the absence of a garden, a good terrace is the best alternative! In the pandemic circumstances we find ourselves in, outdoor spaces have resurfaced, so it is a good time for you to give a more personal and vigorous touch to your terrace. Use your imagination or consult with professionals, and create a garden area that makes you feel like you are in a beautiful garden. Keep in mind that having so many plants at home, you have to create an irrigation system, whether automatic or planning to do it yourself by hand. It is important to keep plants well-fed and watered so that they look in all their splendour, and that they can decorate your garden or terrace in the best possible way.",
            "A great idea for small spaces! Take advantage of the walls and add a touch of decoration by integrating nature into your interiors and/or exteriors."

This beautiful spa has exquisite interiors, custom-made furniture and all the requisite amenities tied together within intelligent spaces designed for the comfort of the spa's clients.",
            "From the stylish reception area to its interiors containing saunas and steam rooms, every section of the spa is avant garde and stylish. Interior designers have integrated cutting-edge technology and modern design to create intelligent customized layouts that prioritize the customer needs and comfort while creating aesthetically pleasing spaces. Although each section of the spa has been developed to contain different routines, their layout, color and designs reflect the activity for which they are destined. Let us explore every section of this beautiful spa.",

Stunningly beautiful lights placed strategically around the reception and waiting area create a strong impression of the Spa's personality without intimidating.",
            "In a commercial outlet related to wellness and health the first impression is very important, which is why the designers have proposed a reception that is clearly divided into two environments. We start with the customer service area equipped with a modern counter and direct lighting that bathes the region with stylish lighting fixtures highlighting every detail.",

            "The waiting room is spacious and minimalist with just the right amount of furniture to maintain comfort and enhance feeling of spaciousness with limited elements.

Here the eclectic combination of warm brown, beige and white colors,  complement the interiors in a functional and aesthetic way.",

These environments can be achieved with closed cubicles or divisive spaces within a room, which has been charmingly achieved by these curtains to provide privacy. When working with small spaces where some luxuries cannot be adopted it is very important to provide solutions such as sliding/folding doors or curtains which create extra space and generate a good flow for clients moving through the space.",
            "The installation of dividers and drywall structures allows a flexible adaptation of spaces and a much more practical and functional decoration. The adoption of the beige background and dark toned wooden details enhance the decorative pieces on this storage area in a simple way, giving personality to the place.

A space designed for rest but that, in the intimacy of its walls, houses many more experiences, encounters, confidences and, ultimately, unique inspired complicity among many other things, for a cosy and warm atmosphere.",
            "It is precisely its walls that end up being key pieces in the design of this room in the home, a space designed by and for two that, in any case, responds to specific needs without leaving aside the aesthetic component. In this book of ideas, we propose a tour of around twenty romantic, cosy and intimate bedrooms but, above all, 20 rooms whose walls play a determining role when conceiving the space. Ready for a walk-through inspiration?",
            "Don't panic, you won't have to set your bedroom on fire to give the wall the burned look we're looking for. A simple coat of paint will be enough to achieve the desired look, a contemporary finish suitable for all tastes.",
            "Exposing a brick wall in the bedroom is an option that does not convince everyone. However, changing the reddish tone for something softer, like white, will make the environment look less harsh and will probably win over your 'partner' more easily.",
            "Have you ever imagined a colourful covering for the bedroom wall? How about some paint? Blue is a fresh and cheerful colour that, however, transmits peace and tranquillity, something basic in the bedroom.",
            "Thebedroomwalls are blank canvases waiting for the teacher to arrive. You can use different textures and colours to generate spaces full of personality. A solution like this in neutral tones, for example, will be ideal for giving the bedroom a sober and sophisticated look.",
            "Wood is one of the materials par excellence for those seeking warmth in their environments. So much so that its use as a bedroom wall covering is more than recommended for those who like to look for that characteristic 'warmth of home'.",
            "The bedrooms are full of original solutions and none of its elements escape becoming a focal point within this space. The headboard is a key piece of any bedroom and can give a lot of play. Illuminating the back will make your bedroom an original and authentic space in equal measure.",
            "If what you are looking for is something that goes beyond the usual proposals or the trends and fashions that everyone follows, why not some padded walls for the bedroom? They are comfortable, and different and the 'newness' is sure to impress your companion. Ready to try?",
            "A couple shares many things, including the design of the bedroom. So that there are no fights, you can opt for a decoration that both parties like. If you share hobbies with your partner, posting photos related to the topic is a perfectly valid option for the design of your room.",
            "The bedroom is a space designed for rest but also a place to enjoy. That being the case, why not use the walls of the room to place a television so you can watch a movie or play a video game? An original and fun idea to continue sharing unique moments with your partner.",
            "Ceiling lights are common when it comes to artificial lighting in modern rooms. An option that you can consider is to adapt this system to the walls to achieve a more original and harmonious image.",

            "They say that opposite poles attract and, as if it were an invisible magnetism, these brick and wood walls form a perfect combination to make this bedroom a unique and singular space.",
            "The use of mirrors ininterior design and decorationis a resource widely used by professionals in the sector. Their particular characteristics make these elements have a very positive impact on the aesthetic aspect of the design. However, beyond the elegance they can provide, mirrors are a perfect resource for spaces in which the dimensions are not too generous and, among their properties, the ability to make spaces look visually larger stands out.",
            "Another resource that you can use when covering the walls of the bedroom is wallpaper. Take it as a game and involve your partner so that you both enjoy the decorative process from start to finish.",
            "Sometimes it is enough to put our talents at the service of decoration to create spaces full of charm. If you have a good hand with brushes, dare to give life to your particular designs on the bedroom walls, motifs that make you dream without having to go to bed.",
            "Decorating the wall of your double room does not mean flooding it with ornamentation. It is enough to reveal its charms in the form of natural materials to conquer with a single glance as in this captivating design.",
            "Lightingis a determining factor in the design of any room but in the bedroom, it becomes even more important. Generating an intimate and personal atmosphere is key to turning your bedroom into a unique space.",
            "They have as many defenders as detractors and the use of pastel tones on the walls of double bedrooms does not convince. However, if you and your partner agree, nothing more is necessary… Let's paint!",
            "In a society in which every square metre is valued at the price of gold, not a single corner of the home should be wasted. That said, the walls of your bedroom can also serve a purpose as displays. In addition to serving aesthetic purposes, they will help you put some order in the room, what more could you ask for?",
            "To taste the colours, the saying goes and we will not be the ones to argue against it. Through them we can express thousands of sensations and feelings so if you are thinking about choosing the tone of your bedroom walls, our advice is that you choose the one that best represents love for you and your partner.",
            "Over time, couples reach such a rhythm and synchronicity that they even share particular tastes, such as preferences for a certain material. If so, don't think twice, give free rein to your creativity and incorporate it into the design of your bedroom walls.",
            "If you want to know more proposals for the walls of your room, be sure to read our idea book:15 Best Colours For The Bedroom Walls Of Your Modern Home.",
            "We have already told you about the idea of using mirrors on the head wall, and also about having a part of the wall padded. But what if we combined these two ideas into one? Framing the headboard area with a mirror and leather padding can be a perfect combination of comfort and elegance. The mirrors will give depth to the room, and we can use them to see ourselves when getting ready. We combine aesthetics and functionality in a single element. We love!",
            "We may be accustomed to conceiving walls as the only dividing element in homes, but the truth is that we are wrong. When it comes to distributing a space, we can do it not only with partitions but we can also do it by introducing other elements, such as lattices. It is a perfect method for dividing spaces without the harshness of a partition, and it allows us to make the rooms we need independent, but also perceive a continuity of space. They can be made of metal, or wood, with different designs, with or without glass… You have infinite options to choose from, and creativity is endless.",
            "We are used to seeing fabrics in furniture, such as sofas, headboards, sofas… And on the walls, we usually see different colours for modern double rooms, in the form of paintings. But the truth is that it is very interesting to be able to use the fabric for the walls themselves. This provides warmth and forms an exquisite envelope for the interior of our bedroom. Although we can create texture with other materials, fabric provides us with a much greater feeling of well-being and comfort than any other material."

These panels make it possible for the facade and roof to be built as a monolith out of one material and completely smooth. The result is a modern building with a traditional look.",
            "The house, which dates back to 1935, shines with a new façade in light green. The colour matches the shutters and the fence of the house perfectly. This creates a great unity of house, entrance area, fence and front garden. The red roof provides a very attractive contrast to the light green house.",

            "People born under the sign of Taurus are considered authentic connoisseurs who like to surround themselves with beautiful things, take care of others and draw strength from nature. The perfect house for them is therefore in a green area, is big enough to welcome lots of friends and must also meet the taste of its residents in aesthetic terms.",
            "Aries are said to be spontaneous, strong-willed and passionate, real doers with lots of energy and drive. Their home needs to reflect and support all of these characteristics. So the ideal is plenty of space both inside and out, combined with a clean edge and little to no ornate details.",
            "The zodiac sign Sagittarius is often associated with a thirst for adventure, a desire for freedom and flexibility. Sagittarians are usually on the move a lot, looking for new experiences. They would prefer to take their home with them—perhaps on wheels or in the form of a houseboat.",
            "Geminis are generally very open and receptive to new things and are also communicative, innovative and curious in a positive sense. They like to have an overview and don't want to miss anything. Their perfect home is spacious, open and not too secluded, with large windows and a fantastic view.",
            "Scorpios have their own opinions, a strong will and a clear view of their goals. But because they don't reveal everything straight away, they often seem mystical and mysterious to those around them. The tendency not to open up to everyone straight away is also reflected in their ideal home, which should protect their privacy and ward off prying eyes.",
            "Sensitive and emotional, but also assertive and passionate—these adjectives apply to many Cancers. Their homely side likes it cosy and comfortable, not too hectic and nice and relaxed. That's why they usually love more traditional houses, but with a modern touch, without fast-moving trends and big frills.",
            "Most Leos don't believe in understatement. They are self-confident, proud and real leaders—and like to show this to the outside world. That's why their house must not be run-of-the-mill but must have that certain something that attracts attention and comes across as distinctive.",
            "Analytical, disciplined and structured—these are the most striking characteristics of Virgo, who always keeps an eye on the little things and details and always knows how to get the best out of a situation. Ideally, their home combines clarity, beauty and functionality and can therefore be inspired by the Bauhaus style.",

            "Capricorns usually achieve what they set their minds to because they are determined, strong-willed, persistent and ambitious. They like their home to be safe, practical and stable, with a traditional, classic touch, but not old-fashioned or kitschy.",
            "Aquarius needs his freedom and loves the extraordinary. This star sign just can't be too cramped—literally and figuratively. The ideal Aquarius house has large windows, open spaces and agardenor a spacious roof terrace.",
            "Pisces are often very sensitive, compassionate and in need of harmony and are also characterized by their tolerance and helpfulness. This zodiac sign cannot cope with too much hustle and bustle around them and likes to retreat into their home, which gives them security and safety."

            "Energies play an important role in Feng Shui teachings. Everything is designed to allow chi, the positive energy, to flow freely and have a positive impact on the lives of those living in the house. However, negative energies should not be given a chance to spread in the house. Today we have brought you ten tips that can help protect yourself against bad energy. There's a lot you can do to stimulate the harmonious flow of chi—from a tidy home to fresh air, houseplants and the right accessories to optimal furniture positioning. Are you wondering how you can remove negative energy in Feng Shui by cleaning your house or what does salt have to do with the whole topic? Then you should read on.",
            "Do you want to cleanse your rooms of negative energy? Most of you are probably familiar with Feng Shui in this context. But many people are not aware of what exactly is important if you want to get rid of negative energy and how you can achieve an impressive improvement in the quality of your living with small changes and tips. For this reason, today we have put together ten great and effective Feng Shui ideas for you that cost little or nothing and are very easy to implement. For example, find out how you can smoke out negative energy. Smoking with sage is a particularly popular method. House cleaning also plays an important role in Feng Shui. So make sure that your apartment is always clean and tidy. You will see that you will feel much more comfortable.",
            "By the way, for anyone who wants even more inspiration, we have put togethera home cleaning service—A guide to hiring excellent professionals.This is a great way to start getting rid of negative energy in your house.",
            "The cracked vase, the chair with the loose back, the cupboard with the worn-out door: in Feng Shui, there are no greater energy robbers than broken objects. So you should get rid of anything defective or damaged. This has a liberating effect—not only on you but also on the chi, which can flow freely again. By the way, repairing doesn't always help. Once a plate or vase has a crack, it is not enough to repair it. The breaking point will always attract negative energies.",
            "Bad air disrupts our concentration and well-being and also suffocates any positive energy. That's why it's important to ventilate well regularly and thus create a pleasant, fresh indoor climate. If the air can circulate freely, so can the chi.",
            "The ultimate tip fromexperts:The more cluttered your home is, the harder it is for the energy to flow there. In Feng Shui, junk is nothing but blocked energy and must be removed accordingly. Regularly and consistently clear out everything that you don't actually need and free yourself from unnecessary ballast, both physically and mentally.",
            "Houseplants filter the air in the room, regulate humidity and are even able to break down environmental toxins. They can also reduce stress and have a calming effect on our psyche. In Feng Shui they also fulfill another task: they increase the chi in closed rooms. This means: With the right plants you can protect yourself against bad energy. Spider plants, aloe, cyclamen, orchids and bamboo are particularly helpful.",
            "A plant like this immediately creates a beautiful atmosphere in your home. Try it out and benefit from the positive effects of the plant.",
            "Salt plays an important role in Feng Shui because it not only has a therapeutic and antibacterial effect on food and medicine but also helps us to improve the indoor climate in the home. It binds dust, allergens and odours through the humidity and neutralizes bad energies. In addition to the classic form, salt can also be brought into the room using salt lamps, washes and accessories made of salt.",
            "Mirrors are particularly important in Feng Shui teaching because they not only create a more spacious feeling but also activate the chi and thus improve the flow of energy. However, there are a few things to keep in mind when hanging: Distorting mirrors should be avoided, the optimal position is opposite doors and entrances, and it is better to avoid mirrors in the bedroom as they quickly cause unrest.",
            "We stay in the bedroom and focus on the optimal position for the bed. According to Feng Shui, the installation location not only influences the aesthetics of the room but also the quality of our sleep. The headboard should be against a solid wall that conveys security. It must point neither towards the window nor the door. In general, the bed should not be too close to the window or door.",
            "You should pay particular attention to the entrance area because it is the gateway into the house and the lives of its residents and as such is extremely important for the flow of energy. The front door should convey stability and security, the hallway should be sufficiently lit and subtly show the way into the apartment. The room effect should be light, bright, airy and friendly. So it's better to avoid aggressive colors and shapes.",
            "Roomscents have a great effect on our subconscious and well-being. If you use the right scents, you support the flow of chi and can protect yourself against bad energies. For example, citrus scents have an invigorating and refreshing effect and floral scents have a relaxing and calming effect. Tree scents such as sandalwood and myrrh have a regenerating and balancing effect, while earthy vanilla and honey notes can have a sensual and erotic effect.",
            "Cleanliness is the be-all and end-all of Feng Shui. Chi cannot flow properly between dust and dirt. Therefore, you can get rid of bad energy according to Feng Shui with regular house cleaning. This includes vacuuming and mopping, tidying up, taking out trash, cleaning windows, and eliminating anything that might disrupt chi."

Even curtains that were originally made for the bathtub are not a popular decoration in modernbathrooms.Not to mention that they are not designed to prevent water from escaping from the shower.Expertsalso say that nowadays, showers are being used more and more, and bathtubs are being used less. This has led to the emergence of numerous options and designs that are available to us in the shower enclosure market. No matter which shower enclosure you choose, it is important for bathroom comfort. After all, it insulates the shower area and prevents unpleasant water splashes that can even lead to accidents in the bathroom.",
            "But first, the question is: what type of shower enclosures are best? Of course, this depends entirely on the shower and the bathroom that the enclosure should fit into. It is advisable to take into account the type of shower we have (or want to install), the material of the walls, the faucet and much more. At the same time, the shower is part of the entire bathroom, so we should also think about how to create harmony between the two. Then, we should learn about the options available and think carefully about what characteristics the shower enclosure should have to choose the perfect model.",
            "Before you decide on a particular shower enclosure, you should know the options you have to choose from.",
            "There are shower enclosures made of various materials, such as glass or acrylic. But you should also think about how tight they are. Should the shower be sealed or not and do you want it to be completely closed? There are also various openings available: for example, the shower can be open on one side or have a sliding or folding door. Of course, there are also many variations in terms of design, as the materials can have different surfaces.",
            "To choose a suitable shower enclosure, we must first consider what features it should have. To do this, we must think about who will be using the shower area; both age and lifestyle play a role here.",
            "It is best to decide beforehand whether safety, lightness, speed, ease of maintenance, ease of access, appearance or other properties are important to you. This will help you choose the right shower enclosure.",
            "Another point is the design of the bathroom and shower area itself in which we want to integrate the partition. The key factor here is the shape of the shower to which the partition must be adapted. But this is not the only factor we must take into account. Of course, we should also know the exact dimensions.",
            "Sliding doors are the most commonly used shower enclosure because they can be easily adapted to different shapes and sizes of showers and do not require any additional space to open.",
            "Partitions with sliding doors are recommended in small showers with limited access space, as they take up hardly any space and thus make access to the shower easier.",
            "Traditionally, partitions with sliding doors were not particularly aesthetically pleasing, as many had built-in aluminium profiles, which made cleaning particularly difficult. Today, partitions have evolved greatly in terms of design and we can find partitions where you can even easily remove the doors yourself without them losing their watertightness later on.",
            "One of the advantages of double doors is certainly their appearance, which always looks stylish. However, you should make sure that the materials are easy to clean. The doors also guarantee easy entry and exit from the shower, as they do not require a lower guide. Double doors usually work with hinges that allow the doors to be folded to either side.",
            "A major disadvantage is the extra space required to open them. Therefore, the use of hinged doors is often limited to larger bathrooms. However, you can also opt for a door that takes up less space and still offers a clean and modern look.",
            "As we have already seen, folding doors are not the best option for everyshower.For example, it is not recommended if we only have a small bathroom. In this case, we should not choose a model that takes up extra space for opening and potentially makes the room seem even smaller.",
            "For small rooms, fixed shower walls made of glass or acrylic are often an excellent solution.",
            "Fixed walls are also used when the shower has a special shape, for example, an additional element that needs to be taken into account. In this example, we can see that only part of the shower could be fitted with a glass wall. In this case, simply installing a sliding or folding door would have been almost impossible.",
            "Glass shower enclosures are usually made of tempered glass, which ensures safety and stability against breakage.",
            "These shower enclosures made of solid glass that reach up to the ceiling can almost completely do without a complex casing. The anchoring is done to the floor and ceiling using small metal profiles, which ensures watertightness. This design is particularly recommended if you want a modern look with clean lines and a minimalist aesthetic.",
            "The glass panels can have different surfaces. They can be transparent or made of translucent glass. There are different degrees of opacity, for example, satin matt using screen printing, or translucent surfaces combined with transparent areas, although the latter has become less common in recent years.",
            "We also have the option of choosing a mirrored surface or allowing a certain degree of reflection. The latter option is ideal for small bathrooms as the effect can make them appear larger.",
            "As we have already seen, the increased use of shower enclosures has brought about great developments, both in technical and aesthetic terms. Great progress has also been made in improving the behaviour of materials concerning humidity and the chemicals with which the enclosures come into contact daily. For example, materials with optimal protection against humidity are increasingly being used, and glass with anti-limescale protection or self-cleaning treatments are being optimised.",
            "In terms of appearance, the partitions can be produced in different colours and even allow the use of adhesive images, screen printing or vinyl. Therefore, the current models adapt perfectly to your wishes and ideas."

It was a dream for the house owner to get closer to nature and open up the enclosed space, creating a spacious home for the growing family. The designers made a significant renovation by opening up the walls by stacking up the bricks to make way for air and light, stealing space for a courtyard, and harnessing the rustic charm of concrete and bricks. The house is a harmonious amalgamation of modern and minimalism, strength, and intricacy that joins to create a cozy, comfortable family home.",
            "The combination of red brick blocks, the sturdy concrete walls, and the lightweight blocks build up a majestic and welcoming façade of thehouse. The bricks are placed perpendicularly to each other so that there are gaps for air and natural light to seep but obstruct the direct view of the neighbours and passersby’s. Strategically placed garden lights wash the walls in a delicate glow.",

In these visualizations we can see the final product in detail, with the possibility of making modifications and changes according to our desires and conveniences, duly advised by a professional specialist in the field, thus ensuring that our home looks exactly as we always dreamed. In today's article, we show you 20 house facades, in 3D models, that will surely inspire you to design your project. Come and discover them on homify!",
            "Combining textures and colours, such as stone, metal and different shades of colour, makes the facade of the house much more interesting.",
            "Wood is a very attractive material, but there is no need to overuse it in the project. A few details here and there will make your home look wonderful, especially if you want to achieve a modern and contemporary design.",
            "Smooth finishes are very attractive as they are icons of modern design. Also note the hierarchy of the wood element in the main entrance, which makes the door appear to be double in height.",
            "Some flowering plants, or some vegetation, can be placed flanking the access paths to the main entrance, demarcating and framing it, which looks especially good in houses with a contemporary design.",
            "This facade is special for small, two-story houses, with compact facades that can have a great visual impact.",
            "Integrating vegetation on balconies, sidewalks and other parts of the facade gives thehousea much more interesting appearance and better integrates the construction into the surrounding environment.",
            "A large vertical component can help differentiate the various sections of the residence'sarchitecturalcomposition and breaks the monotony of a design that extends horizontally, with an elongated shape, providing greater stability to the proposal.",
            "The entire architectural language used in the ironwork of this facade is the same, giving cohesion and uniformity to the entire project, and making the facade much more attractive and sensible.",
            "This facade works a bit like a curtain, as the balcony that opens at the top serves both to appreciate the surrounding landscape and to integrate the landscape into the interior of the house.",
            "A complex and unique design for the railings that will protect the house or garage will make them the focal point of the design, accentuating and complementing the rest of the architectural composition of the house.",
            "Roofs or cladding panels can give a much more interesting and attractive tone to the facade of the house, especially if you play with the different levels to create a floating effect and greater height, especially if it is a single-storey house.",
            "The volume of compositions on facades always tends towards balance, static or movement. The latter is achieved by proposing a volume that stands out from the others at one end, like the one seen in the image, over the main entrance of the house.",
            "Several horizontal elements create a beautiful visual effect that gives great personality to this facade, adding to the excellent combination of textures and colours that the different finishes on the walls of the residence provide.",
            "A volume with a contrasting texture, like the volcanic rock cladding of this house, highlighted against the prevailing white, gives a modern and contemporary style to this simple facade.",
            "There is nothing more modern than using white, neutral and light tones to add more light to a facade. If we add to this a very green garden in front, we ensure a winning combination.",
            "In this photo, at the end of the balcony, a plant barrier was proposed, perfectly combining with the warmth of the wood that covers one of the walls of the main facade of this beautiful residence.",
            "This facade is sober and simple, but very pleasing to the eye, thanks to the combination of tones used in the proposed painting, which combines perfectly with the exposed brick elements and the wooden entrance door.",
            "A vertical and perpendicular element to the rest of the house can serve as a plane that intersects it and gives a differentiating touch to the visual composition of the facade, delimiting areas and balancing the overall design of the house.",
            "Also remember that you can combine styles, as in the image proposed, where a house with a gable roof is still modern and contemporary, but simultaneously gives a nostalgic feeling, thanks to the windows and tiles covered in dark grey.",
            "Houses with one floor become much more familiar and welcoming, as shown by this project for a house with a simple facade, where the garage slab appears to be a single piece that runs through the entire building and creates the roof structure.",

            "Leather chairs are timeless and stylish — they're an obvious choice for an upscale look. But there are more benefits to leather furniture. If you want your armchair to get even more comfortable as it ages, then leather is a great choice. It's made to become more supple as it's worn in over time, and it's durable enough to resist fading. Leather is also usually of exceptional quality and won't easily peel or crack like other materials might. It's also easy to clean with just a few wipes, and it's long-lasting so you won't need to replace your chairs for a while.",
            "If you think the benefits warrant a higher cost, consider leather chairs or armchairs. While you may have to put more money in initially, leather is an investment worth making.",
            "These grey leather chairs fit in nicely in this dining room. With a neutral like grey, you can easily add more colour to the room or keep it minimal and decorate only during the holidays. The cutout on the back of the chairs add an interesting detail but they'll still be comfortable because of the high back.",
            "These funky slightly low-back chairs match the unique look of this room. Opting for neutrals like brown can be a good choice if you want other areas of the room to shine, like the walls, a piece of artwork, a rug, or a coffee table.",
            "These dark brown glossy chairs look great in this dining room. With a regal silhouette, these chairs are simple but add dimension to the room. Plus, leather chairs are comfortable enough to survive a long meal, even in this long hall.",
            "These dark leather chairs add dimension to the room — don't be afraid to choose darker colours when it comes to leather. While lighter leathers can be pretty, darker leathers look rich and luxurious.",
            "If you want to forgo a usual leather chair in favor of something different, try adding a leather bench to your living room. It's a good option for guests or putting your feet up after a long day.",
            "Leather doesn't have to mean glossy — suede chairs a nice option if you like a softer material. Suede is also more casual, and would look lovely in a western-themed home.",
            "For tired arms, pick out a chair with oversized arms. This glossy brown leather armchair screams luxury and urban. Perfect for placing by a large window.",
            "This classic armchair shape looks marvelous in leather — if you're an introvert, you won't want to leave this spot all day, especially because that leather is so comfy!",
            "A wingback chair is a fun choice if you like a lot of support. Whether at your desk or in your living room, this leather chair will be plenty comfortable.",
            "This armchair has barely there arms that won't get in your way (if bulky armchairs aren't your thing!).",
            "What could be more relaxing than a leather recliner? Featuring soft, supple leather, arms for resting, and a footrest, this chair will de-stress you no matter what you're going through.",
            "When you need to get moving, find a chair that can get you there. This leather rolling chair would be a fantastic option for an office.",
            "Another classic look, this black leather chair looks effortlessly stylish in this living room. We'd love to sit and read a book there.",
            "Leather chairs are the ideal complement to a library or bookcase — there's simply no comfier place to sit and read a good book.",
            "Leather can translate to the kitchen. Getting leather highchairs can be a good option for you if you like to entertain guests or want to upgrade your old stools.",
            "Consider leather for your living room furniture if you want durability, a stylish look, and a piece that you can use again and again."

Installing shutters is a popular option, but when we think about ground-floor security, it takes more than that. Nowadays, there are a variety of grilles that not only provide more security but also decorate our homes with their design. We have brought you 20 fabulous examples to help you choose the perfect protection for doors andwindows!",
            "Beautiful and with a charming flair: Our first example is double glazing with internal grilles. The delicate, light design of the grilles further underlines the style of the house and guarantees greater security.",
            "Robust, stable and durable: The decorative iron grille not only offers more security for the front door but also beautifies the entrance area.",
            "The steel grid that we see in this example is characterized by a straight, minimalist design and creates an open, airy feeling of space.",
            "To match this impressive entrance area, the grilles were decorated with delicate, decorative objects reminiscent of abstract flowers.",

            "This lattice construction looks traditional and modern and makes the entrance look particularly charming. A wooden lattice was installed to match the front door and complemented by additional glass inserts.",
            "Another way to provide your home with more protection is to install a grille in front of the window.",
            "It looks particularly harmonious when the grilles reflect the style of the house, as we can see in this example. Here the grille in front of the window becomes a decorative highlight.",
            "In this case, the white front door was fitted with glass inserts, which became an individual eye-catcher thanks to ornaments.",
            "Away from the traditional grilles for windows and doors, there are now wonderful designs that decorate the outdoor area. Here, delicate, flowing lines have been used to create a unique door grille.",
            "A very special design is this window protection, which is reminiscent of a plant and beautifies the entire facade with its modern design.",
            "The geometric pattern of this lattice is a central eye-catcher and additionally decorates the terrace. In addition, the seating area is protected at the sides by sliding glass doors.",
            "For this artistically designed window, diagonally arranged, overlapping bars were created, which offer a high level of protection while maintaining the decorative character of the window.",
            "Double protection for the windows: In this example, double glazing was combined with internal grilles and shutters made of light wood.",
            "The window grille becomes an eye-catcher when you paint it in bright colours. In this case, the yellow fits wonderfully into the tropical surroundings.",
            "For houses in a minimalist style, grids with straight lines and no decoration are best suited.",
            "Who says a grille always has to be installed outside? Here we see an example of how wonderfully it can be placed inside too.",
            "Grilles are now available in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, so there is a design to suit every window.",

            "Stairsare often the number one accident site. While peeling paint and squeaky steps indicate a need for renovation, a rotten staircase or a step with a broken edge is a real accident hazard. But how do you know if a staircase needs to be repaired and what can you do if the steps need to be refurbished?",
            "When it is time to repair a wooden staircase depends on the appearance, but also on safety. While old wooden staircases tend to squeak and their paint looks worn, this does not necessarily mean they are a source of danger. Staircases with clearly worn-out steps, a wobbly railing and rotten wood, on the other hand, urgently need to be repaired so that they meet safety requirements again.",
            "If the paint on the steps and railings looks worn out and is already crumbling, the stairs can be made to shine like new again with little effort. Before the stairs can be repainted, however, the old paint must be removed. Depending on the type and design of the stairs, this is not so easy. Especially if the stairs have a beautiful railing with turned elements, the old paint must be removed carefully so as not to damage the wood. Removal with a hot air dryer is particularly suitable if the stairs have several layers of paint. The method is particularly cost-effective because no expensive paint strippers need to be purchased and, if used correctly, paint removal with a hot air dryer is extremely effective. Users should wear a mask to avoid inhaling toxic fumes and the wood must not be burned with the hot air dryer. You can usually tell that the paint is hot enough to be carefully removed with a spatula by the formation of bubbles on the surface of the paint. The more ornate the stairs or bannisters are, the more important it is to use tools of the right size. Under no circumstances should the paint be removed with force. After removing the paint with a hot air dryer, the wood can be filled, sanded and repainted as required. A combination of natural-coloured wood with a coloured painted bannister looks stylish, especially if the steps are still intact.",
            "Scratches, dents and pressure marks on the steps look unsightly but are not a safety risk and can usually be removed without much effort. Scratches and small dents can be repaired with wax. The easiest way for the hobbyist to do this is to use a ready-made repair kit. In addition to wax in various colours, this usually also contains sandpaper and a spatula. This method is suitable for both solid wood and imitations such as laminate. Before the scratches can be repaired with wax, surface treatments must be removed with sandpaper. Splinters and crumbling material are removed and the edges are sanded smooth. The wax is then warmed up and worked into the scratches or dents. To ensure that the surface is smooth, a cotton cloth is placed on the waxed area and ironed over. Once the wax is cold and hardened, the area can be finely sanded and sealed.",
            "Broken corners not only look unsightly, but they can also cause injuries. If small splinters stick out from them, you can pull them into your skin when climbing stairs, and if the broken corners are too big, they can cause falls. If the corners have broken out so far that the steps are different depths, the step must be completely replaced. If several steps are badly damaged, one option is to build over the steps. The new steps are cut to the millimetre and the old steps are built over with the new material. The old core of the staircase can be retained and the entire staircase does not have to be ripped out. If you are planning to have your staircase built over, it is best to get advice from one of our experts beforehand.",
            "If the corners are only slightly damaged, they can be repaired using simple means. To do this, splinters and broken areas are sanded down and adjusted to the edge of the stairs. The step is then resealed—with wood varnish for example in the case of wooden stairs—and shines with new splendor.",
            "If the steps of the wooden staircase are very damaged, you should consider whether it is worth replacing them individually or whether it might be appropriate to replace the entire staircase. This depends on how complicated the replacement would be. If the staircase is only attached to the wall, it can usually be easily dismantled and a new staircase installed. However, if replacing the staircase would involve major demolition, it is worth repairing the broken steps. Broken steps are best rebuilt. This is best done by aprofessional.However, laying new steps is also quite easy if they are covered with suitable wooden panels. If it is possible to dismantle individual steps because they can be unscrewed individually, replacing the entire step is the simplest and cleanest solution.",
            "Wood works. It expands when exposed to moisture and contracts when it is dry. This is also reflected in wooden stairs that creak and squeak. If the creaking of the stairs is due to shrinkage of the wood, this is usually remedied by using small wooden wedges that are pushed into the resulting cracks. If the steps are bent and creak as a result, they are reinforced from below. Both methods are quite common, but can only eliminate the cause of the creaking if the construction is not faulty.",
            "Stairs are often the focus of accidents. They don't even have to be damaged for this to happen. Even intact stairs can cause accidents if, for example, the steps are difficult to see or the step length does not match the size of the steps. Stairwells and stairs in the home should generally be well lit and the edges of the steps should be easy to see. The stairs are not the right place for flower pots or other decorations. They should generally be free of obstacles and allow people to pass them without being disturbed. In terms of the tread, the steps should ideally be between 26 and 32 centimetres deep and have a step height of at least 14 and a maximum of 19 centimetres. The safest option is a railing that offers a secure hold when using the wooden stairs. The steps themselves should be completely intact. Worn, smooth steps, a broken light bulb in the hallway lighting and greasy or loose handrails on the stair bannister can lead to accidents and should be repaired as quickly as possible.",

            "Curtains are real all-rounders and for most of us, they are simply part of the perfect living experience. No wonder: They make a room cosy. In addition, they protect us from being blinded by the sun and from the curious glances of neighbours and passers-by. Curtains also act as sound absorbers within the four walls. So it is not surprising that even today, especially in theliving room,curtains on the window are an absolute must-have. We have taken a look and brought you some ideas from our professionalinterior designersfor curtains for the living room—both classic versions and super modern looks. Click through and get inspired!",
            "",
            "",
            "Natural materials and fabrics such as linen, cotton, hemp, wool or silk are currently very trendy in Sahen interior design. This also applies to trendycurtainsand drapes. They are simple, discreet and understated, score points with their high quality and ensure cosiness and comfort in the living room and co. unobtrusively and timelessly.",
            "Natural charm is also the focus of this curtain variant. Pure white and filigree patterns are complemented by delicate pastel tones for a convincing and well-rounded overall picture that fits into any room situation. The perfect choice for anyone who likes dreamy romance but wants to avoid kitsch.",
            "No way it's stuffy! This combination proves that you can decorate your windows in a stylish and contemporary way with curtains and drapes. Subtle geo prints and cool black-and-white contrasts create a fresh, trendy look that will liven up any living room and at the same time make it feel very homely.",
            "Curtains not only make bare windows appear friendlier, but they are also ideal for emphasizing your interior design style. Here we see a room that has been decorated in a country house style and complemented by a matching curtain with a playful pattern. This picks up the floral elements of the cushions and carpet and thus emphasizes the relaxed, natural effect of the room.",
            "Curtains—at first glance, that always sounds a bit like grandma's living room, like lace, ruffles and gold edging, like stuffiness and bad taste. The fact that this association is just a prejudice is proven by the numerous modern curtains that are available on the market today. They score points with high-quality fabrics and a simple, contemporary design, with neutral colours and understated patterns, and thus adapt easily to the modern living environment.",
            "The terms curtain and drape are often used as synonyms. But are they the same thing? On closer inspection, it can be said that a curtain is traditionally always characterized by transparency. It can be floor-length or cover only part of the window, made of voile, lace or batiste, but always lets light through. The advantage of curtains for living rooms and other rooms is therefore obvious: the window does not look bare and you are protected from prying eyes inside without having to forego sunlight and light. In contrast, a curtain is opaque and is usually made of heavier fabrics. It is usually floor-length and can be combined with the curtain on the window as desired.",
            "Here we see an absolute classic at the window—the combination of a floor-length curtain and a drape, which on the one hand gives it colour and on the other hand darkens the room even more if necessary.",
            "Whether curtains or drapes: With both versions of the window decoration you can set stylish accents in your four walls. If you use them as a design element and coordinate their colour, pattern and material with other home textiles such as cushions, blankets and carpets, the overall picture appears extremely harmonious and coherent. In addition, you can also use an unusual curtain or an unusual drape to make a specific statement in the room and create an impressive eye-catcher.",
            "In modern living rooms, alternatives to classic curtains are increasingly being used. Simple and understated interior design is very much in vogue these days. As a result, pleated blinds are becoming increasingly popular because they allow windows to be designed clearly and simply. You also have the option of providing privacy and sun protection in a very flexible way, depending on your needs.",
            "Another popular alternative to the good old curtains today is panel curtains. These are similar to conventional curtains as they are also transparent and translucent. Unlike falling curtains, however, they consist of smooth, floor-length fabric panels in various widths, have an extremely puristic appearance and therefore fit perfectly with modern interiors.",
            "In some rooms, for example, the bedroom, you want it to be dark when necessary. Blackout blinds or pleated blinds are a great alternative to the classic curtain-curtain combination.",
            "Instead of a classic curtain, you can also opt for Venetian blinds in front of the window. These are modern external blinds that reliably keep sunlight out and are also visually appealing. Unlike with a classic roller shutter, with a Venetian blind, you can choose and align the angle of the slats as you wish and thus let sunlight in or block it out in a very targeted manner.",
            "If you want to create a special eye-catcher on the living room window, you can opt for a combination of curtains and pleated blinds, which combines the advantages of both options and, with coordinated colours, creates a very modern, yet homely and cosy atmosphere.",
            "There is even more to window fashion. Here we see a successful combination of transparent curtains, opaque curtains and sliding pleated blinds. The colour coordination creates a very special spatial effect and a stylish ambience that makes you feel good.",
            "If you want to hang curtains in your living room, you should make sure that the measurements are correct. For floor-length curtains, the hem should end about 1 to 2 centimetres above the floor. If you decide on short curtains, the rule of thumb is that they should end 5 to 10 centimetres below the window frame. As far as the width goes, you usually need 2 to 3 metres of fabric for one meter of window.",
            "When the curtains are finally hanging, it is important to remember to take care of them properly so that you can enjoy your window decorations for many years to come. Experts recommend washing curtains and drapes 2 to 4 times a year. Most fabrics can be washed at 30 degrees on a gentle cycle. Important: Only spin at a maximum of 800 revolutions!"

            "Starting a new building project is exciting and stressful at the same time. On the one hand, you're looking forward to the new home for yourself and your family. On the other hand, of course, there are many small details that you mustn't lose sight of. The most important question for everybuilderis of course the question of costs. Cheap building materials can make a huge contribution to keeping overall building costs low. It is of course helpful to know which materials are suitable for your new little dream home. For this reason, we have put together 12 inexpensive building materials for you today that are not only easy on the wallet but are also particularly suitable for a small home. Let our ideas inspire you. Are you ready?",
            "Manufactured and cut to size on site and installed immediately,prefabricatedfacade panels in modular construction are not only particularly cost-effective. They also enable the construction project to progress quickly. The best thing about it is that these panels are available in every shape and a variety of different materials. This means that even on a small plot of land, a perfectly adaptedhousecan be built that, thanks to the various modules, has everything we want from a home. A great option, especially on small plots of land.",
            "When it comes to modern design, it is the tried and tested concrete slabs that are prefabricated units that can quickly and inexpensively form a new home. No longer misunderstood as brutalarchitecture,concrete creates a uniformfacadethat exudes a suitably sealed, restrained, modern flair. In this example, you can even see the hint of a classic roof. A great idea.",
            "In order to at least partially reduce the construction costs, it is worth taking a closer look at the facade of your future home. Natural stone elements are often inexpensive alternatives for external cladding. Designed and used accordingly, the natural building material will add its own charm to your small home. A refreshing way to visually enhance your house while saving on your construction budget.",
            "The ultimate form of recycling and probably the actual origin of the modern modular house. The homemade from former shipping containers represent a combination of modernity and sustainability like no other. Individual modules can be combined in almost infinite ways, so you can create your very own dream house with a terrace and garden for very little money. Isn't that just brilliant?",
            "Wood is an incredibly versatile and beautifully designed material. It is not for nothing that wooden houses are among the absolute evergreens when it comes to house building. Just as you can conjure up ingenious pieces of furniture from discarded Euro pallets, it is possible to create a new home from recycled wood that deserves its name. The cost of this is just a fraction of what a completely new building would have cost.",
            "We are particularly familiar with corrugated iron from simple low-rise buildings or local garden sheds. It is inexpensive to buy in any hardware store, quick to install, extremely durable and has already made a name for itself in roof construction. Something that works so well on the roof can't be bad as a facade part, can it? For a small home in an elegant, industrial style, the corrugated iron used creates unexpected highlights. No matter whether it's stormy or raining, this beautifully designed facade holds up!",
            "If tradition is to be believed, a small bamboo plant not only brings a great flair to your four walls but also prosperity. Bamboo has been established as a building material for many centuries. And what works in traditional Far Eastern house building also works here. Let's be honest: doesn't this little bamboo house look stunning? Unbeatable in terms of natural look. Perfect for smaller home projects on a budget and with a penchant for the Far East.",
            "In modern design, there are more and more trends that are based on the natural forms of flora and fauna. Curved metal elements that appear stable on the one hand, but playful on the other. But it also works the other way around. With conventional RSJ iron beams, a frame can be created quickly and inexpensively in which the new home can find its place. Due to their positive properties, these beams do not necessarily have to be plastered but can remain visible to everyone. This way you can create a modern home for little money and with a gorgeous industrial touch.",
            "We all know them from our own experience—even if we have never built a house ourselves before. Red bricks are simply the absolute classic in a building. There are good reasons why this material has been on the market for so long. Not only is it durable and quick to install, but it is also extremely economical when it comes to building costs. Bricks may not seem very individual, but it should be said that bricks are only the basic material for your dream house. Thanks to the low cost, this basic material gives you a lot of freedom for your ideas.",
            "At first, it sounds like we're not talking about a family home, but about a stable. But that's a complete disservice to the natural material straw. Its properties as an ideal building material, which is not only ecologically sustainable but also particularly cost-effective, are now convincing more than just die-hard eco-house builders. The best thing about it is that a straw house guarantees absolute individuality. If you don't believe it, you can be convinced of the opposite here: A little house with a fantastic highlight. It is great!",
            "We usually build our house on a plot of land, starting either in the basement or on the ground floor. In this example, we see a completely different method, which would not even come close to being described ascreative. Instead of spending huge amounts of money on expensive facade elements and building materials, this project was simply built into the stone. As a single-storey bungalow, it is surrounded by natural stone and is ecologically absolutely brilliant, not only thanks to the green roof area. It almost looks like an igloo made of stone, doesn't it?",
            "Hardly any other material is as inexpensive to buy and as easy to work with as fresh concrete. When mixed on-site, it has also been proven to be extremely stable and is particularly popular with home builders on a budget. If you also have a penchant for a modern, understated home, you can't go wrong with concrete."

Today technical advancement like 3D interior rendering and architecture design has made it possible forarchitects, interior designers and decorators to portray their vision in an accurate and precise manner. Architectural design is a complex art which requires experience and knowledge along with vision to understand client requirements and turn it into reality. Interior design architects work like skilled craftsmen to create detailed designs of different parts a home’s interiors and present it before prospective house owners. In recent years this has been largely facilitated by advanced technologies like 3D interior design rendering and 3D architectural visualization software.",
            "Here are some examples of different 3D architecture designs that our experts have made for clients as part of they designing process. The advantage of these designs are that they help customers understand and feel the layout of their houses before they are made so they can changes wherever required before the construction begins.",
            "",
            "3D architecture rendering has helped builders to try out various interior design layout combinations with their architects and clients. These are shown to potential home buyers as a part of their catalogs and through advertisements to attract their attention. When required, architects can make adjustments in the design layout to suit aesthetics or remove flaws before starting work on the actual project site. This 3D architecture design gives viewers exterior plan of the house about how it will appear from outside.",
            "This technology helps make architectural designs tangible. This helps to understand and share visualization to colleagues and clients without spending time in building scale models. Besides taking out guesswork and theoretical details of architectural drawings and sketches these designs help to pitch unique ideas. 3D designs also help customers understand how light fixtures, window awnings and other details will appear in different situations and scenarios wherever they are used.",
            "See this beautiful detailed design of an office?  Improvement in 3D technology now ensures that designs are no longer pixelated and patchy and look almost like a real one. This helps customers and decorates choose a wide range of materials for surfaces to enhance the color elements. If desired decorators even use  transparent 3D-print elements to enhance specific areas. The office design here is hard to distinguish from a real one.",
            "See this beautiful kiosk style flower store? This looks like a typical kiosk commonly found near large shopping malls or hospitals where there is a frequent demand for flowers. The artist has presented the layout from different viewing angles which helps the prospective owner understand the impact of light and display structure.  Dimensions of every section from seating to work area, customer service area and display section are clearly laid out in this architecture idea.",
            "Designing commercial areas takes more time and detailing in comparison to planning the interiors of a residential area. When a 3D model is made for it before the actual construction is done saves time and money. Models in color can be shown to clients that will help to source materials for the work and enhance designing and building procedures. These models provide accurate details so architects and designers do not have to waste time making errors in judgement with regard to colors and dimensions.",
            "The well laid outmodern dining roomhere looks as real as can be. The designers have given the view of the region as it will look during daytime with light streaming in through the windows and making the flowers on the table literally sparkle with life. The 3D idea here shows the importance of natural light.",
            "Small kitchen layout shows how important it is to have all essentials of the right right dimension to ensure everything fits well into allotted spaces.",
            "This sliced up drawing gives a rough idea about how a single bedroom with limited floor space can be designed well to ensure every inch is used up.",
            "We love howBalcon Architectshave created a 3D design of an indoor pool of a large mansion style home. Every detail from shadows to light shining off the water gives a realistic view of how the pool area will look once it is ready to use.",
            "This 3D design may look like a realistic model but it is a computer generated model of the insides of a two bedroom house. Minute details have been planned into the drawing from the layout of the various rooms to where all essential appliances and furniture will be kept.",
            "These various designs show how important 3D architectural designs are used by manufacturers of furniture, lighting, flooring, paints and even decor items in their catalogs to show how their products can be used in the best way.  To help you in sourcing the best design for your house here areessential things to consider before buying a house plan."

            "Patioand terrace roofing can made of materials such as glass, fabric, reed or wood, fixed or mobile, and some are flexible and can even be adjusted when it is needed with a click of a remote control.",
            "We all love our terrace house in the summer, but as the seasons change, we are often surprised by the harsh weather conditions and find ourselves grateful for those days when we're not shooed off from theterracebecause of rain showers. Even during the lovely evenings, we enjoy a shaded terrace so we don't get have to worry about the evening dew which could potentially have unhealthy effects on children. More so, covering the terrace is also a good way to maintain your outdoor furniture, prolonging the lifespan of yourloungechairs.",
            "But the question is: Which terrace roofing is the right one? At homify, we have a wide range of options available, designed byarchitectsand interior designers, and some of them are even more detailed.",
            "The tried and tested version is a pergola-type covered with traditional roof shingles. This is quick and easy to build because a part is attached directly to the house and its stability is obtained by the wooden pillar construction on the opposite side. Fast growing vines give the terraced roof its shade and exudes a rustic and romantic appearance. Caution: When planting, always make sure that it does not attack the foundation of thehouseso it doesn't weaken the structure of the walls.",
            "An extremely flexible variant of the roofing of a terrace is this: If you want to enjoy the full portion of the sun, you simply remove the textile. On the other hand, if rain is to be expected, the textile can be stretched to cover the entire frame of the roof ceiling, and after the season, you can simply take off the fabric and wash them out. Also, interestingly enough, notice how its poles are bolted onto the walls instead of the floor.",
            "Or how about this filigree type of ceiling for thepatio? It hardly keeps out the rain unless you have a fiberglass cover on top of the material, but nonetheless, it still provides good sun protection. So if you are looking for a solution that simply filters the light and at the same time, utilizing a sustainable natural material for the terracing roofing, then the choice is a reed-roofed variant.",
            "A panel of tinted or frosted tempered glass is the right choice for those who want a bit of shade while warding off the rain. The fixed version is a bit more costly, but this structure is very durable and will last you for many years, you will just have to find someone who would occasionally clean those panes.",
            "A sail-like stretch fabric is a light and summery roofing variant, which in comparison to the sunshade is also safe in some windier areas. An additional advantage of a sail as a terrace roof is its flexible suspension: Depending on the requirements, you can always use it in different areas. And, with the appropriate choice of materials, a sun sail could even protect against rain. So, it is better to check if it has water-resistant properties, and don't forget to read the specifications on cleaning the fabric, whether it's washing machine safe and such.",
            "The covered awning on the terrace as a roofing solution is the right choice for all those who want everything. An awning can be extended if you need protection from the sun or rain and in perfect weather, you can simply let it retract and make yourself comfortable without a roof on the terrace. A further advantage of the awning is that it is available in many different colors and materials and you can also decoratively place a special highlight on the terrace!",
            "This patio is characterized by an extremely versatile concept. The relatively simple wooden construction is used not only as a nice roofing solution but also as a curtain rod for curtains, which can protect you from the wind, gust from the rain and from prying eyes. In addition, a mixed version of transparent and opaque components was chosen for the roofing. So you have no sun directly above the table, which melts the cream cake, and the outer terraces can still have enough light so that one is not sitting in the dark.",

For the answer, check out these awesome small terrace designs.",
            "Once again, we see the use of a wooden deck in thepatio. The interior designer has made the maximum use of the charming view of the surroundings. Except for a few potted plants, the patio does not boast of any ornamentation at all. The lean-to roofing system with wooden beams partly protects this space from the natural elements.",
            "This terrace design is so simple yet inspiring. It is built on a wooden deck and forms a part of astylish buildingwith a white façade. The space is decorated with comfortable armchairs and a simple coffee table. Like the house itself, the furniture too is steeped in a spotless white tone.",
            "The architect of this contemporary home has made a very smart choice. The entryway of the house has been converted into a comfortable terrace. A simple wooden bench is placed against theexposed brick wall. The other end of the space is decorated with green plants in wooden planters.",
            "This secluded house is designed with a spacious corner terrace, which is erected on wooden stilts. The terrace overlooks the charming valley just beyond the precipice. Like some other buildings on this list, this terrace does not have any ornamentation. Its simplicity and the natural wealth of the surrounding act as beautifying elements for this house.",
            "Exposedconcrete flooringand walls can be used in a variety of ways in a contemporary building. The platform terrace of this house is one prime example of that.

Potted plants act as beautifying elements of the entire patio area.",
            "While having an open terrace on the uppermost level of the house is everyone’s dream, don’t neglect safety and comfort when designing the terrace.

With its natural ventilation, acourtyardhelps the house stay appropriately warm or cool without the need for heaters and air conditioners.",
            "In a warm climate, a courtyard can bring down the house’s temperature, saving on energy bills. Several courtyards also include natural cooling elements as a part of their design like a fountain, a basin, an artificial waterfall, thick external walls and double-glazed windows.",

            "A courtyard can be enclosed as well, like the one here, which stretches along the wall that is common to the living room and dining area.Skylights overheadflood the room with natural light, replicating the experience of an authentic outdoor courtyard but with the comfort of airconditioning. The zen design theme enhances the ambience and spreads serenity throughout the area.",
            "For centuries,interiorcourtyards have been created to aid the purpose of natural ventilation. Ventilation itself serves many purposes. It provides fresh air, improves oxygen supply and dilutes odours. When planning courtyard architecture, keep room for cross ventilation, which offers the maximum cooling effect.",
            "Courtyard ventilation also has passive cooling effects during the night, which brings the overall temperature of the place down. In addition to this, a courtyard filled with plants and a garden area helps keep the house cool even in scorching and arid climates.",
            "A courtyard acts as a space separator within the home. An indoor courtyard between the living room and bedrooms, can work to increase the privacy between these areas, not letting casual visitors walk in unwittingly. It provides a break in the décor too, with each section gaining a new personality that goes only with the central flow.",

The design ensures that the tree can be viewed from the differentlevelsof the building. Moreover, it optimises the natural light in the building to create a cheerful and comfortable work environment.",

            "If you love and enjoy your connection with nature, you can take it a step further in your courtyard. You can not only plant decorative plants, but also\nuse a small area for vegetable and herb farming. Your own little patch of\norganic farming can find a wonderful place in your courtyard where sunlight and\ncool breezes will keep it company. When you start with courtyard planning for\nedibles, always go for ones with a quick turnaround time—between 60-90 days, like\nleafy greens—which can be harvested before the change of season. Also, choose\nto plant these in a pot than directly in the soil, so that you can move them around\nin case of an unexpected downpour.",
            "There are different types of lawn grass that can be replicated in\npatches in your courtyard that can envelope your feet in morning dew. Choose\nthe local soft variety that doesn’t attract insects, and is fairly resistant to\nclimatic changes. Or if you don’t have the time to grow or maintainplants,\nthen deck the place with pebbles, rocks, and pieces of wood for an organic feel.",
            "A courtyard with beautiful and comfy seating area, flowing curtains, plush rugs and quirky coffee tables can be an ideal spot for quiet reflection, meditation,\nreading books, or enjoying a cosy chat. It can be a place to unwind, entertain,\nconnect with nature and enjoy the simple pleasures in life.",

Here the stylish shower area is against the wall and close to the windows so the trendy bathroom due to flow of natural air and light and is always clean and dry. The large handles on the sliding doors are easy to use as well as save space.",
            "Designing a stylish storage area in a small bathroom while maintaining all essential details is a tricky job. ButGarra + Punzal Architectshave managed to do exactly that by setting up a storage cabinet under the wash basin and also setting up a spacious storage region close to the ceiling.",
            "There is no law that says that bathroom furniture should only be above the counter or below the counter or on walls because the lighting is better. Place a low hanging lamp for counters or add small stools that are lying idle elsewhere in the house and can add beauty to stylish bathrooms by placing plants etc. on it. An old chair has been artfully renovated here to work as a grooming area and towel rack.",
            "Why not add a bathtub when you have space to set up one in your bathroom? This oval-shaped bathtub against the gorgeous grassy wall gives the bathroom an exquisite look and creates a spa-like atmosphere. This bathroom idea with elegant cabin style stage and ceiling lighting encourage you to spend hours soaking after a long day at work.",
            "Water splashing all over the bathroom is a common problem whenever one takes a shower if the region is not secluded. With this kind of rimless glass design, you can enjoy your own shower cabin, which, despite being part of the attractive bathroom, seems almost invisible!",
            "If you lack budget to build cabinets are are worried that water and warmth in the bathroom will lead to early rot then go for this kind of industrial style storage racks. One of the most common bathroom design ideas now is to set up wall decorations by swapping some from other rooms or to print some favorite online pictures from the internet or find some favorite postcards and decorate it in a antique frame.",
            "If you are a lover of luxury and display that around the house then why stop at the bathroom door? Keeping the decor style of the house in mind designers have created a spa or hotel-like atmosphere with artful design elements. The eclectic combination of pearl, gold and brown color palette make the region look modern and give serious bathroom designing goals.",
            "To keep a small bathroom fresh and airy maintain it as a clutter free zone. Here is a bathroom that is a heady combination of light elements, neutral colors, light pink sandstone tiles and a shower area with a frame-less glass panel that plays a primary role. The trendy cabinet area area is a smart bathroom storage idea that makes effective use of vertical space.",
            "Love the old Victorian style? Our designers here have used an old ornate mirror with character to bring that element of nostalgia into this bathroom. Along with ceiling lights the candle-stand style wall light holders add to the bathroom ambiance. This is what we call a modern day classic style bathroom design idea.",
            "The sandbar design tiles on the walls of this small bathroom make it a very modern and unique place. While the sink and sanitary pot are close to each other the shower area is in a separate part. The use of stone on the counter and white sanitary-ware integrates these spaces visually, so the use of light colors in small spaces is never wrong while the integration of lighting around the counter area is done in a consistent fashion.",
            "The mirror here attracts our attention immediately due to the beautiful blue wall and plants visible in it. Linear placement of showers, sink and chamber pots make this bathroom a functional space. The storage area above the chamber pot and transparent shower area make this bathroom feel spacious.",

            "Minimalist design style is characterized by simple and spare decor, clean lines, limited silhouettes and muted color palette based on the logic of “less is more”. Thoughinterior designers and decoratorsusing this style do not shrink away from using vibrant and rich colors they use it skillfully to retain an uncluttered and simple environment that is warm and inviting instead of being cold and sterile. An important part of minimalist design is functional division of decorative objects and furniture in the house in a casual manner so as to retain plenty of natural light and enhance its architectural details. This look can be achieved by investing in minimalist storage details and keeping a tight rein on embellishments and exotic decor items that people tend to accumulate during overseas trips or get as gifts. Here are some easy to implement ideas anyone can use to bring minimalist style of decoration into their homes.",
            "Though some minimalist designers prefer to remain frugal and sparse while designing layouts minimalist decor is not always low budget or about spending less. Common minimalist design trends include adaptation of designer fixtures like designer light fittings, unique electrical equipment and contemporary details to decorate without clutter. Here we see aminimalist living roomidea with interesting combination of floor lamps and drop down lighting arrangements.",
            "Modern adopters of minimalism in interior decoration are people that are tired of ostentatious details and crave elegant simplicity. To achieve this one should avoid non-functional furniture parts and embrace open spaces in the house. Here minimalist interiors are dominated by the spaciousness that welcomes in plenty of natural light and pushes it to every corner of the house.",
            "A minimalist bedroom is a comforting oasis of light colors which are just a few shades different in tones and feature an eclectic combination of furniture and furnishings in similar light color palette to maintain consistence. The bedroom room here is a well edited example decorated with neutral colors that are easy on the eye like cream, white, beige andindustrial style lightingin black.",
            "Use thoughtful assortment of furniture and furnishings to create a balanced living space that is both comfortable and light. Simple pieces that can stand on their own and compliment the other pieces spread across the house and are value for money without looking cheap are the best.",
            "Combination of multiple textures is another minimalist design style that raises simple decor above several notches to extraordinary. Texture here is being offered by using materials wall paper, dining chairs with unique patterns and stylish light fixtures that blend form and function in a functional home item.",
            "if you have a large piece of art then use it as a focus point in a public part of the house either the living room, foyer or corridor end and allow it dominate the region.  Bring life and excitement to austere regions with a splash of colorful painting whilst retaining light furniture simple, modern furniture around the area.",
            "A common minimalist kitchen idea is to keep it as open as possible and fuse it with rest of the house with as little wall barriers as possible.  Sometimes people get carried away with minimalism and layout is made of poor quality materials and features. Instead keep things cheerful and bright in the kitchen by using large windows to let in natural air and light. Enhance the light color palette with bright colored appliances and dishes while staying clear of unwanted clutter in the form of unnecessary prints and designs on cabinets, walls or floor. Limit the kitchen design to simple crafted cabinetry and minimalist storage solutions to keep the region organized and store majority of things out of sight.",
            "Modern minimalist design does not imply complete lack of accessories as then the house would look sadly aseptic. Decorate with collectible accessories for showcase residents' personality and taste in each room to make the home unique. To get it right make tactical use of decor pieces and   routinely swap these aesthetically pleasing accessories every season to create soothing effect. We love the minimalist den design here with light sprinkle of colorful cushions below floating shelves with simple artistic pieces.",
            "If your home is located in a strategic place like atop a hillock or in a multi-storied complex and has  a phenomenal view then exploit it to the maximum by keeping walls to a minimum and using glass.  Keep the views as the focal point across the house and limit furniture. Use focal artwork on the wall or in strategic places and plenty of indoor plants that look startling against the exterior landscape like here.",
            "The study area featured here has blinds that are appealing enough to add a note of sophistication to any kind of layout. As they are partly sheer and are almost from ceiling to floor their fluid lines are in touch with the minimalist decor style of the room with simple wooden furniture and open floating shelves built into the wall.",
            "Straightforward mix of minimalist colors like black and white with a dash of grey gives a charming finish to this mid sized bathroom. We love how the straightforward use of just three hues and interesting coordination of white accessories with straight lines against dark background  brings minimalist touch to the region. Keeping the surfaces free of clutter brings a sense of calm and cleanliness to the space.",
            "An essential part of minimalist style is using natural light and limited materials to create forms that stay embedded in the design. Base architecture should be constructed with style to meet functionality goals and visually unite the entire house. Floors should be on par to create connections between rooms with minimal joint lines like here where the music room and living area gracefully merge.",
            "Scandinavian style is quite similar to minimalist that relies on simplicity of form and lines to emphasize starkness of design. Here areinteresting ideas to nail Scandinavian style."
